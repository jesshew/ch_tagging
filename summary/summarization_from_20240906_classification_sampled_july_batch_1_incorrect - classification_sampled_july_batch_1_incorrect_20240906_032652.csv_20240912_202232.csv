Primary Concern: Received the wrong drink  
Identified Problem: Inability to resend the correct drink due to policy restrictions

Resolution Offered: Refund processed to the customer's ZUS balance, with the option to reorder  
Overall Summary: The customer initially expressed frustration over receiving the wrong drink and requested a resend.

user: hello
user: Good afternoon, I need your help. My name is wang zekun, I have a zus account, registered with a mobile number of +60148772572. I still have a balance of about 25.85 in this account, and this account is bound to my credit card with the last digit 0247. Because I changed my mobile number, the mobile number used to register the zus account is no longer in use, and I can't receive the verification code, so I can't log in to my account and use the balance. Now I need you to help me refund the balance of my account registered with the mobile number +60148772572 to the credit card bound to this account, or transfer the balance to my new account registered with a new mobile number, which is +60104319345. At the same time, I need you to help me unbind the credit card with the last digit 0247 bound to the original account +60148772572, otherwise if my invalid mobile number is used again by the operator, my credit card may be stolen. Thank you, looking forward to your reply.

","Customer sentiment: Frustrated

Overall Summary: The customer, Nur Ain, expressed frustration over multiple order cancellations due to rider unavailability and sought a refund to her bank account rather than a balance in the ZUS Coffee app. The agent acknowledged the issue and submitted the refund request, but the customer was dissatisfied with the initial handling and communication regarding the refund method. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of high inquiry volume causing delays and a misunderstanding about the refund process.",1897

Primary Concern: Inquiry about matcha promotion and additional discount with tumbler  
Identified Problem: Lack of clear information regarding the promotion and discount eligibility  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the timeframe for a response (initially stated as 48 hours)  
- Potential system or procedural delays in confirming promotion details  
Resolution Offered: Agent promised to follow up via email within 24 hours with the necessary information  
Overall Summary: The customer reached out to inquire about a matcha promotion and whether they could receive an additional discount using a tumbler. The agent initially provided unclear timelines for a response, which frustrated the customer due to the urgency of the promotion starting the next day. The agent later adjusted the response time to 24 hours, indicating a willingness to resolve the issue, but the initial miscommunication contributed to the customer's frustration.",1741

451477,Outlet,Operation,Performance - Barista Behaviour / Service,"Hi there,
I am at Jaya One right now and I just ordered a CEO latte from counter, when I read in the receipt that I have actually earned 9 Zus Points from the order. 

When I try to scan the qr it leads me to nowhere. I checked with your cashier they told me if purchase made from counter (not from the App) needs to provide mobile no. Clearly your cashier did not ask me prior to my order and they told me it is too bad they can't do anything about it. 

As a first time Zus App user and also a new Zus customers, I feel kinda disappointed towards your staffs here although your coffee is serve as good as my expectations. I am a seasoned home barista for years FYI. 

Just sharing an experience at Zus Jaya One.

","Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Missing promotional sticker from the order  
Identified Problem: Misallocation of the last sticker to another order despite the first-come, first-served policy  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication from the outlet regarding stock availability and allocation  
- Insufficient stock management leading to customer dissatisfaction  
Resolution Offered: Apology from the agent and escalation of the issue to a team leader for further assistance  
Overall Summary: The customer, Yihui, expressed frustration over a missing promotional sticker that was supposed to be included in their order. They noted that the last sticker was allocated to a subsequent order, which contradicted the first-come, first-served policy. The agent acknowledged the issue and apologized, but the customer felt that the response was inadequate and that the outlet's handling of the situation was unsatisfactory. The agent escalated the matter to a team leader and offered to have them contact the customer, but the customer remained dissatisfied with the service and expressed intent to file a formal complaint. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of miscommunication and poor stock management at the outlet.",3925

Primary Concern: Missing velvet cream in the drink  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the inclusion of velvet cream in the order

- The agent's troubleshooting steps may not have resolved the customer's inability to attach images  
Resolution Offered: Confirmation that the velvet cream was included but likely melted due to the hot drink  
Overall Summary: The customer initially raised a concern about missing velvet cream in their drink. Throughout the chat, they expressed frustration over their inability to attach an image to support their claim. The agent provided troubleshooting steps but ultimately confirmed that the velvet cream was included in the order, suggesting it had melted. The interaction concluded with the customer satisfied with the clarification, despite the initial confusion.

Primary Concern: Missing Hot Velvet Crème in the order  
Identified Problem: The Hot Velvet Crème was either not added or completely dissolved in the hot drink, leading to the customer not being able to taste it.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the preparation of the drink, specifically the addition of the velvet crème.  
- Potential inconsistency in the outlet's preparation standards for the Hot Velvet Crème Latté.  
Resolution Offered: A complimentary drink voucher for the Hot Velvet Crème Latté was provided to the customer.  
Overall Summary: The customer raised a concern about missing the Hot Velvet Crème in their order (Order ID: 24072801217). The agent confirmed that the outlet team indicated the crème was added but may have dissolved due to the hot temperature of the drink. The customer expressed frustration, noting this was not the first occurrence of this issue. The agent offered a complimentary drink voucher and assured the customer that the matter would be investigated to prevent future occurrences. The root cause appears to be a combination of miscommunication about the drink preparation and potential inconsistencies in service standards at the outlet.",4667

My purchase last night


agent: Upon checking you didn't purchase enough cups during the quarter when you became a ZUS Elite. That's the reason why your level has been downgraded.
user: Why?
agent: For further details, you may refer to the FAQ of this program in the app.
agent: To maintain your membership as a ZUS Elite, you have to collect a minimum 16 cups in one reward period.
agent: Upon checking, you only purchase 3 cups without using the voucher.
user: Yes i know..but to become zus elite i must purchase 8 cups of coffee right?
user: Last night i purcase my 8th coffee..
agent: Any voucher code or promotional/combo item utilised while purchasing any beverages from the ZUS App, please note the cup count will not be counted in your account. Beverages purchased without any discount/voucher code will be eligible for the cup counts and ZUS point(s) will be added to your ZUS account for every purchase.

agent: For yesterday's purhcase, you were using a ZUS15% voucher and the purchase is not entitled to cup count.
agent: *purchase
user: Ye betul
user: Tp last night i ada beli coffee 2kali
user: One with voucher and one without voucher
agent: Yes correct.
user: So sepatutnya dah cukup 8/8 cofee la
agent: Currently, you are a Rising Star. In this tier, you must collect 9 cups before being upgraded to the next tier.
agent: We suggest you refer to the ZUS Coffee Club FAQ in the ZUS app.
agent: Your current cup count is 8/9.

agent: Please refer to the downgraded - quarter section.
user: Ye sy faham
user: Before i purchase semalam dkt my apps dah tulis macam ni “collect 1 more cup by 30jun to become zus ellite ”..then smlm i purchase on 30jun 9.39pm
user: Mengikut kefahaman sy..if i beli coffee 1 cup smlm i akan jadi zus ellite
agent: You have become a super addict, you didn't collect enough cups. That's why you have been downgraded to a rising star.
user: Which part yg i xcukup cups tu?
agent: You only purchase 2 drinks that have not used any voucher.
agent: Any voucher code or promotional/combo item utilizes while purchasing any beverages from the ZUS App, please note the cup count will not be counted in your account. Beverages purchased without any discount/voucher code will be eligible for the cup counts and ZUS point(s) will be added to your ZUS account for every purchase.

agent: The message stated you have to collect 8 cups before 30 June, which means that you need to purchase 8 cups without using any vouchers. If you don't use any vouchers, the cup count will be counted.
agent: Since you didn't collect enough cups and today is the 1st of July, a new quarter, your level has been downgraded once again.
agent: Hope the explanation clarifies you and we are sorry for any inconvenience. 

agent: Is there anything else we could assist you with?
user: Then how about my points last night?

When we send the invitation code to friends, we don’t watch them register, but we are afraid that they will make a mistake when registering and fill in the wrong code. This is very disadvantageous for us because we will lose an invitation voucher. Because I am a Zus elite now, if I get one, I can get a 70% discount.

Primary Concern: Double payment charges and inability to receive a refund  
Identified Problem: The payment system did not register the bank transfer, leading to confusion and frustration for the customer.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer attempted to pay twice due to a failure in the initial transaction.  
- The app's instructions led the customer to believe the payment was successfully processed, but it was not reflected in the system.  
Resolution Offered: The agent stated that a refund would be processed for the double payment charge, but later indicated that they could not issue a refund as only one payment was received. The customer was advised to check with their bank for further details.  
Overall Summary: The interaction centered around the customer's complaint regarding double payment charges. The customer initially paid through their bank, which was not recognized by the coffee chain's system, leading them to pay again using a different method. The agent confirmed receipt of only one payment and advised the customer to contact their bank for the missing funds. The root cause appears to be a failure in the payment processing system, which did not accurately reflect the transactions made by the customer. The customer expressed frustration over the lack of resolution and clarity regarding their issue.",2730

I'm writing in regards to your outlet Zus Kulim, Kedah.

I placed 2 ordered separately. Topped up RM3 for Oat base. However, your staff ZyFaa said Oatside out of stock in replacement for Oatly.  I requested to made one for Oatly base, the other to Almond base. That's simple.
Totally disappointed with your staff insisting both had to be same choice of base!
I beg your pardon, could you explain on her behalf what's wrong with the staff understanding of customer's request.

Very dissatisfied with the service & ordered. Making payment of what a customer's choice yet we couldn't get what we wanted. We wish to have an explanation if it means to compensation for a drink of Almond base.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Primary Concern: The customer wants to apologize to a staff member for their previous behavior.  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the customer's intent and the nature of their complaint.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer expressed frustration with their order, leading to an emotional response directed at the staff.  
- The chat agent struggled to understand the customer's request, leading to repeated prompts for menu selections instead of addressing the apology directly.  
Resolution Offered: The agent assured the customer that their apology would be communicated to the staff member involved.  
Overall Summary: The customer initiated the chat to express regret for their earlier behavior towards a staff member named Imrah after receiving a replacement drink. The main issue stemmed from the customer's emotional response to their order, which they later recognized as misplaced. Miscommunication during the chat led to confusion, as the agent repeatedly prompted the customer to select from a menu rather than addressing their specific request. Ultimately, the agent confirmed that the customer's apology would be conveyed to the staff member.",3048

agent: Thank you and have a pleasant day ahead! 😊","Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incomplete drink order (hot green tea latte) received  
Identified Problem: Possible inconsistency in drink preparation or quality control at the outlet  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer has a history of receiving full drinks, indicating a change in service or product quality  
- Lack of clear communication and understanding between the customer and the agent regarding the issue  
Resolution Offered: Replacement drink offered, pending customer confirmation for pickup  
Overall Summary: The customer, Kelly, expressed frustration over receiving two hot green tea lattes that were not filled to the usual level. Despite her attempts to clarify the issue, there was a lack of effective communication with the agents, leading to confusion. The root cause appears to be a potential inconsistency in drink preparation at the outlet, which was not addressed satisfactorily during the chat. A replacement was offered, but the interaction ended without a clear resolution as the customer felt unheard.",4285

","Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect order received and missing items  
Identified Problem: Order fulfillment error leading to missing items (Matcha Strawberry Latté and sugar sachets)  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication during order preparation  
- Lack of available delivery personnel for replacement orders  
Resolution Offered: Replacement order sent free of charge, but refund for the original order was not reflected in the customer's balance  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced an issue with their order where they received the wrong item (only a caffe latte instead of the Matcha Strawberry Latté) and did not receive the requested sugar sachets. The agent acknowledged the mistake and offered to send a replacement order at no cost. However, the replacement order was later canceled due to the unavailability of a delivery rider, and the customer expressed dissatisfaction with not receiving the refund in their balance. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of order fulfillment errors and logistical challenges in delivery.",4581

Primary Concern: Missing butterscotch crème in the butterscotch latte
