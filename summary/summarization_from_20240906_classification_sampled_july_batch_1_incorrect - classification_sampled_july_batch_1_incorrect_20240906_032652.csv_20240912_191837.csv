Primary Concern: App malfunction during purchase and pending refund  
Identified Problem: System error leading to app downtime and unresolved refund

","Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Payment error due to a refund despite receiving the order  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the payment status and order delivery
