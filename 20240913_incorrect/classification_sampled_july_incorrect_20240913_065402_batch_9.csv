Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery due to unavailability of a driver  
Identified Problem: Insufficient number of riders available in the customer's area  
Contributing Factors:  
- High demand for delivery services in the area  
- System limitations in assigning drivers to orders  
Resolution Offered: Auto-refund of the order to the customer's ZUS balance and options to reorder or self-pickup  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a delayed order that had not been assigned a driver for over 15 minutes. The agent explained that the order was still in the ""allocating driver"" status due to a limited number of riders available in the area. The customer was informed that if a driver could not be assigned within a certain timeframe, the order would be auto-cancelled and refunded. Ultimately, the order was auto-refunded due to the inability to allocate a rider, and the customer was given options to reorder or self-pickup. The root cause of the issue was identified as a shortage of available riders in the customer's vicinity.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,SLOW RIDER ALLOCATION,90,Slow Rider Allocation,5873

",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Hot Food,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: The customer received cold food instead of hot/warm food.  
Identified Problem: The food was not reheated before delivery, leading to it arriving in a cold state.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of proper food handling or reheating procedures by staff before delivery.  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the expectations for food temperature upon delivery.  
Resolution Offered: The agent suggested contacting the Customer Happiness team for further assistance and emphasized that feedback would be forwarded to the relevant team to prevent future occurrences.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving cold food instead of the expected hot/warm food. Despite having eaten the food already, the customer highlighted that this was not the usual standard and emphasized the importance of proper food handling procedures. The agent acknowledged the issue and assured the customer that their feedback would be used to improve service, but no immediate resolution was provided since the customer did not seek a refund. The root cause appears to be inadequate reheating or handling of food items prior to delivery.",ORDER ACCURACY,80,WRONG ORDER / ITEM(S),75,Wrong Order / Item(s),6001

Hi Tengku Danial Malik,     ​We will reply in a separate email.   Thank you!     -- Best Regards,   Atieqah Asma Customer Happiness Specialist     E. support@zuscoffee.com  W. www.zuscoffee.com",Outlet,OOS,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Disappointed  
Primary Concern: Customer did not receive the promised free Matcha Macam sticker due to it being out of stock.  
Identified Problem: The sticker was out of stock at the specific outlet where the customer made the purchase.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The policy that customers can only claim the free sticker from the outlet where the order was made.  
- Lack of communication regarding stock availability at the time of purchase.  
Resolution Offered: A refund was processed to the customer's ZUS Balance, and instructions were provided on how to check the balance in the app.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Carmen, expressed disappointment over not receiving a free sticker that was promised with her order due to it being out of stock at the outlet she visited. The main issue stemmed from the store's stock availability and the policy that restricts claiming the sticker from a different outlet. The resolution involved processing a refund to her account, but the underlying problem indicates a need for better communication regarding stock levels and policy clarity.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,75,MISLEADING / DISSATISFACTION,85,MISLEADING / DISSATISFACTION,4577

",Delivery,Slow Delivery Service,Pandago,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order preparation and delivery  
Identified Problem: The order was delayed due to the rider arriving late to pick up the order from the outlet.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was placed over 45 minutes prior to the inquiry, exceeding the expected preparation and delivery time.  
- Lack of timely updates regarding the order status, leading to customer uncertainty.  

Resolution Offered: The agent provided the rider's contact information and confirmed that the order had been picked up, but did not offer a solution to expedite the delivery.  

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a significant delay in their coffee order, which had been in preparation for over 45 minutes. The agent clarified that the delay was due to the rider arriving late to pick up the order. While the agent provided the rider's contact information, the lack of proactive communication and timely updates contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction.

 Dear Lau Yu, 
   
 Greetings from ZUS Coffee. 
   
 
Since the order was made via Grab Food, unfortunately, we are not able to process the refund from our end due to double payment charge. In this case, kindly reach out to Grab Food by going to Grab Food App > Click the 'receipt' logo at the top right, tap on your order > Tap on 'Contact Grab'.  The team will proceed with a refund from their end.
 
 Meanwhile we recommend that you kindly contact customer service to request a refund, as we are unable to proceed further from our end due to the order being placed using Grab.  
   
 Thank you for your understanding. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any further concern or inquiries. We'll be right with you.

Primary Concern: Request for a refund due to extra charges on a Grab Food order  
Identified Problem: The inability to process the refund directly due to the order being placed through a third-party app (Grab Food)  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer experienced unexpected extra charges on their account after using the Grab Food service.  
- Lack of immediate resolution from the coffee chain's staff, leading to the customer being directed to customer service instead.  
Resolution Offered: The customer was advised to contact Grab Food directly for the refund, as the coffee chain could not process it on their end.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Lau Yu, expressed frustration over being charged extra for an order placed through Grab Food and sought a refund. The coffee chain clarified that they could not process the refund due to the nature of the transaction and recommended that the customer contact Grab Food directly for assistance. The root cause of the issue appears to be the reliance on a third-party service for transactions, which limited the coffee chain's ability to address the customer's concern directly.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND STATUS,75,Refund Status,4696

Primary Concern: Customer is being charged RM1 for a paper bag for a pickup order of more than 4 drinks.  
Identified Problem: Lack of consistency in the application of the paper bag charge policy across different outlets.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer has previously received paper bags without charge from other outlets for similar orders.  
- The customer was not informed about the need to select the paper bag option in the app for pickup orders.  
Resolution Offered: The agent explained the current policy regarding the paper bag charge and advised the customer to select the option in the app for future orders.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being charged RM1 for a paper bag for a pickup order of more than 4 drinks, noting that this was not a consistent practice at other outlets. The agent clarified the policy but did not address the inconsistency issue, leading to the customer's suggestion for an improvement in the standard operating procedure (SOP) to automatically provide paper bags for larger orders. The root cause of the issue appears to be a lack of clear communication regarding the policy and its inconsistent application across different locations.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,85,COMPLAINTS,85,Complaints,5887

",Outlet,Wrong Drink,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect drink preparation (received dairy milk instead of coconut milk)  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication or error in drink preparation  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer received a drink that did not match their order specifications  
- Lack of follow-up on whether the customer received the corrected drink after the barista's assistance  
Resolution Offered: The agent checked with the barista and confirmed that the drink was redone, but did not confirm if the customer received it.

",Customer Account Details,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Withdrawal of funds from ZUS app not reflected in the bank account  
Identified Problem: Discrepancy in the withdrawal amount and failure to receive the funds in the bank  
Contributing Factors:  
- Incorrect amount deducted (RM16.75 instead of RM16.00)  
- Delay in processing the refund to the bank account  
Resolution Offered: Refund of RM16.75 to be processed within the week, with a follow-up if not received  
Overall Summary: The customer, Nurin, expressed frustration over a failed withdrawal from the ZUS app, where the deducted amount did not reflect in her bank account despite a successful transaction status. The agent acknowledged the issue, identified a discrepancy in the withdrawal amount, and assured the customer that the refund would be processed within the week. The root cause appears to be a processing error related to the withdrawal amount and a delay in the transaction to the bank.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND ERROR / FAILURE,85,Refund Error / Failure,7413

- The customer experienced repeated delays beyond the promised delivery time.  
Resolution Offered: Refund processed to the customer's bank account as requested.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a significant delay in their order delivery, which was compounded by a lack of communication and inability to contact the driver or outlet.

user: hello
user: Good afternoon, I need your help. My name is wang zekun, I have a zus account, registered with a mobile number of +60148772572. I still have a balance of about 25.85 in this account, and this account is bound to my credit card with the last digit 0247. Because I changed my mobile number, the mobile number used to register the zus account is no longer in use, and I can't receive the verification code, so I can't log in to my account and use the balance. Now I need you to help me refund the balance of my account registered with the mobile number +60148772572 to the credit card bound to this account, or transfer the balance to my new account registered with a new mobile number, which is +60104319345. At the same time, I need you to help me unbind the credit card with the last digit 0247 bound to the original account +60148772572, otherwise if my invalid mobile number is used again by the operator, my credit card may be stolen. Thank you, looking forward to your reply.

Primary Concern: Coffee cup lid not closing properly, resulting in spilled coffee.  
Identified Problem: The cup was not securely closed, leading to a mess and inconvenience for the customer.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer picked up the order themselves, which may have led to a lack of additional packaging support (like tape or parchment) that is typically provided for delivery orders.  
- The customer was a first-time buyer, which may have contributed to their expectations regarding product quality and packaging.  

Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the order was prepared correctly and stated that a refund could not be issued. The customer was informed that the issue would be forwarded to the relevant team.  

Overall Summary: The customer experienced a significant issue with their first order of a coconut latte, as the lid did not close properly, causing a spill and requiring them to clean up. Despite the agent's attempts to assist, the customer felt frustrated by the lack of resolution and the inability to receive a refund. The root cause of the issue appears to be the packaging standards for pickup orders, which did not meet the customer's expectations, especially as a first-time buyer.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,85,SPILLAGE,85,Spillage,4671

user: please answer me
agent: Apologies, you may wrote down the complaint here and will forward it to the relevant team to check and take necessary action.
user: I often study at ZUS Coffee, and sometimes I don’t order anything. However, today I encountered something that made me very angry and upset. At ZUS Kajang MKH Boulevard, I experienced discrimination from the staff, who told me that if I didn’t order anything, I couldn’t stay there. Is this really your company’s policy? If I ordered something in the morning and went back in the afternoon, do I have to order something again to sit there? I ordered coffee yesterday morning, and today I was told I couldn’t sit there without ordering something? This gave me a very bad experience. A female staff member at your coffee shop repeatedly spoke to me rudely because I didn’t order anything. I need a satisfactory explanation.
user: please answer me
agent: We are terribly sorry for the negative experience.

agent: We will highlight this to the outlet PIC to investigate and take necessary action to ensure this incident shall never happen in the future. 🙏
agent: May we get your email and phone number that has been registered in ZUS Apps?

agent: This shouldn’t have happened to you or any of our customers.
agent: We are putting the highest priority on this issue and will forward it to the relevant team to check and take necessary action to prevent this from happening again.
agent: Once again, we're extremely sorry for the unpleasant experience.
agent: We understand your frustration and we will try our best to improve and serve you better in the future.
user: So can I not have to order every time I sit in Zus?
user: please answer me
agent: We understand that you may want to study at the outlet, but the seating is reserved for our customers at that specific time and date.

agent: If you do wish to study at the outlet, you will need to make a purchase from the outlet on that day and time. We appreciate your understanding.
user: When I was there, many seats in the store were empty, and if I ordered something in the morning, would I need to continue ordering if I went there in the afternoon?
user: You can check my order records on the app. In addition to those, I also ordered directly in the store, which are not shown in the app. I ordered so many things from your company, and I don’t think I should be treated like this.

Primary Concern: Delay in order preparation and lack of communication from baristas  
Identified Problem: Baristas did not check on the order status, leading to a significant wait time for the customer  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of communication and alertness from baristas regarding order status  
- Customer's order was not prioritized or monitored effectively  
Resolution Offered: The issue will be escalated to the outlet's person in charge (PIC) for investigation and improvement

The agent apologized and assured the customer that their feedback would be addressed to improve service in the future. The root cause of the issue appears to be inadequate training of baristas and a lack of clear communication regarding the thumbler preparation process.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,80,MISSED OUT - REMARKS,70,Missed Out - Remarks,6196

Identified Problem: The customer's phone number is not registered in the ZUS Coffee system.
