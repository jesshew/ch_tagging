",Customer Account Details,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to use a voucher after a refund due to delivery issues  
Identified Problem: The customer was unable to use a ""buy 1 free 1"" voucher after their order was refunded because no rider was available. The refund was credited to the ZUS account instead of the customer's bank account.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The delivery service was unable to find a rider, leading to the order being refunded.  
- The refund was processed into the ZUS account rather than back to the customer's bank account, causing confusion and frustration.  
Resolution Offered: The agent offered to process a refund to the customer's bank account, which would take up to 14 working days.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being unable to use a voucher for a coffee order after their initial order was refunded due to a lack of available riders. The refund was credited to their ZUS account instead of their bank account, leading to dissatisfaction and the perception of unfair treatment. The agent ultimately offered to process a refund to the customer's bank account, but the customer indicated they no longer wished to use the app. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of service delivery failures and unclear refund processes.",LOYALTY AND REWARDS,80,APP - LOYALTY ISSUE,75,App - Loyalty Issue,6183

",Outlet,OOS,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incomplete refund for an order that included multiple items.  
Identified Problem: The customer did not receive a refund for all items in the order, specifically the food items (almond croissant and pain au raisin), only for the creamy mango drink which was out of stock.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the cancellation of the entire order by the barista.  
- Lack of clarity on the refund process for multiple items in the order.  
Resolution Offered: A refund of RM10.90 for the creamy mango was processed, but the issue with the food items remained unresolved.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Nur Diyana, expressed frustration over receiving only a partial refund for her order, which included a creamy mango drink that was out of stock and food items that were not refunded. The issue stemmed from a miscommunication at the outlet regarding the cancellation of the entire order and the subsequent refund process. While the agent acknowledged the issue and processed a refund for the drink, the customer was left without resolution for the food items.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND ERROR / FAILURE,85,Refund Error / Failure,7326

Primary Concern: The customer did not receive their order despite the status indicating it was delivered.  
Identified Problem: The order was delivered to the wrong address, which the customer did not recognize.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer’s address was not correctly entered in the app, leading to a delivery error.

Resolution Offered: The agent offered a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance and resent the order to the correct address.

Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer who was likely experiencing an issue with a drink but did not respond to the agent's request for a picture to assist further. The lack of response led to the agent closing the chat, which may have contributed to the customer's frustration. The root cause appears to be a combination of the customer's inability to provide the requested information and potential miscommunication about the necessity of that information for resolution.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,75,COMPLAINTS,75,Complaints,3915

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over the inconsistency in the milk type of their CEO coffee order, noting that it tasted like normal milk instead of oat milk, and there was no indication on the cup to clarify this. The agent acknowledged the issue and submitted a drink recovery request, but the customer was left feeling uncertain about future orders due to the lack of labeling and potential miscommunication. The root cause appears to be a combination of inadequate product labeling and inconsistency in product preparation.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,85,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,4810

Primary Concern: Received the wrong coffee order  
Identified Problem: Incorrect preparation of the coffee order (wrong beans used)  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication or error in order preparation at the outlet  
- Customer's specific dislike for the alternative beans used (Lydia beans)  
Resolution Offered: Refund to ZUS Balance due to inability to collect a new drink  
Overall Summary: The customer, Nirmal, reported receiving the wrong item in their order (Iced Spanish Latte made with Lydia beans instead of BOSS beans). The agent acknowledged the mistake and offered to resend the correct drink, but the customer was unable to collect it. As a resolution, a refund was processed to the customer's ZUS Balance. The root cause of the issue appears to be a miscommunication or error in the order preparation at the outlet, compounded by the customer's specific dislike for the alternative beans used.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,WRONG DRINK,85,Wrong Drink,5857

Primary Concern: Missing butterscotch in the Butterbae drink  
Identified Problem: The drink was not prepared according to the customer's expectations, leading to dissatisfaction with the product quality.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The outlet's chaotic environment may have affected the quality of service and drink preparation.  
- Miscommunication regarding the standard operating procedures (SOP) for drink preparation, particularly the stirring process.  
Resolution Offered: A refund to the customer's ZUS Balance was offered, but the customer remained dissatisfied with the product quality.

Despite the agent's attempts to clarify that the drink was prepared according to SOP, the customer felt that the outlet did not follow through properly, leading to a lack of butterscotch flavor. The chaotic state of the outlet and the agent's reliance on SOPs without addressing the customer's specific concerns contributed to the issue.

Primary Concern: Customer is facing a payment error and is dissatisfied with the refund amount received.  
Identified Problem: The customer expected a full refund of their balance but was only refunded a portion due to the separation of normal and promotional balances.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer was unaware that promotional balance could not be refunded.  
- The customer expressed dissatisfaction with the company's treatment and perceived lack of compensation for their experience.  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed the refund of RM 74.55 and explained the refund process, stating it would take 7 to 14 working days.  
Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer, Steward Tan, who experienced a payment error and was frustrated with the refund process. The main issue was the customer's expectation of a full refund from their ZUS balance, which was not met due to the distinction between normal and promotional balances. The customer expressed disappointment with the company's service and indicated a desire to withdraw all funds. The agent clarified the refund amount and process, ultimately agreeing to refund RM 74.55.

",Promotion / Voucher,Missed Out - Promo Code,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect order leading to a cancellation request  
Identified Problem: The customer received an incorrect order and wanted to use a voucher instead.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was already being prepared by the outlet, limiting the ability to cancel.  
- Lack of clear communication regarding the use of the voucher prior to order confirmation.  
Resolution Offered: The order was successfully canceled, and a refund of RM36.60 was issued to the customer's ZUS Balance.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced an issue with an incorrect order and expressed a desire to cancel it to use a voucher. The agent confirmed the order was being prepared, which complicated the cancellation process. After some back and forth, the order was canceled, and a refund was processed. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of order preparation status and unclear communication regarding voucher usage.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,85,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,4703
