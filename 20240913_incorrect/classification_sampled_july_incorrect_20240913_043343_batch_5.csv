Primary Concern: Reversion of mission points and cup count to the ZUS account  
Identified Problem: Potential system error or miscommunication regarding the status of mission points and cup count

- Lack of clarity on the initial issue that led to the points and cup count not being reflected correctly  
- Possible misunderstanding or miscommunication between the customer and the system regarding account updates  
Resolution Offered: Points and cup count have been reverted to the customer's ZUS account  
Overall Summary: The interaction involved a notification to the customer that their mission points and cup count had been successfully reverted to their account. The primary issue appears to stem from a system error or miscommunication that initially caused the points and cup count to be incorrect. The resolution was implemented by updating the account, and the customer was encouraged to reach out for further assistance if needed.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,85,ZUS BALANCE WITHDRAWAL,60,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,3802

",Payment,Payment Error / Failure,Payment Gateway,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Double payment charges on the customer's bank account

",Feedback / Improvement,Complaints,Marketing,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer did not receive the promotional sticker with their order as expected.  
Identified Problem: The Berjaya Times Square outlet is not a participating location for the sticker promotion, which was not communicated to the customer prior to their purchase.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication regarding the promotion's availability at specific outlets.  
- Customer's expectation based on the promotion's wording, which did not specify exclusions.  
Resolution Offered: A 20% discount voucher for the next purchase was offered, but the customer insisted on receiving the sticker instead.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving a promotional sticker with their order, which they specifically purchased for. The main issue stemmed from the Berjaya Times Square outlet not participating in the promotion, a detail that was not clearly communicated to the customer. Despite the agent's attempts to resolve the situation by offering a discount voucher, the customer remained dissatisfied, emphasizing their desire for the sticker rather than a monetary compensation.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,80,MISLEADING / DISSATISFACTION,85,MISLEADING / DISSATISFACTION,6426

Despite the agent's initial willingness to process a refund, it was later clarified that since the drink was redeemed with a voucher, a cash refund was not possible.

",Delivery,Rider Behavior,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery  
Identified Problem: The order was not delivered within a reasonable time frame, and the rider was unreachable.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was placed at 9:58 AM and not delivered by 11:24 AM, leading to a wait of almost 2 hours.  
- The rider was unreachable, preventing the customer from contacting them for updates.  
- The outlet experienced a water issue later, which affected the preparation of another order.  
Resolution Offered: A new rider was assigned to deliver the order, and a refund was issued for a subsequent order that could not be fulfilled due to the outlet's water issue.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced a significant delay in receiving their coffee order, which was compounded by the inability to contact the rider. After expressing their frustration, the agent assigned a new rider and later addressed a separate order cancellation due to a water issue at the outlet, offering a refund. The interaction concluded positively, with the customer expressing gratitude for the resolution. The root cause of the issue was primarily the delay in delivery and the rider's unavailability, along with operational challenges at the outlet.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,SLOW DELIVERY SERVICE,80,Slow Delivery Service,6043
