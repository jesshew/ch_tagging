When we send the invitation code to friends, we don’t watch them register, but we are afraid that they will make a mistake when registering and fill in the wrong code. This is very disadvantageous for us because we will lose an invitation voucher. Because I am a Zus elite now, if I get one, I can get a 70% discount. I hope you can modify it so that when they register with our invitation code, we can receive a message notification if the registration is successful.

user: 😊",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Drink,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Appreciative  
Primary Concern: Quality of the ordered drinks  
Identified Problem: The drinks did not meet the customer's expectations, leading to a request for compensation.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer received only one drink instead of the two ordered.  
- There was a delay in the response time from the customer service team, which may have contributed to the customer's frustration.  
Resolution Offered: The agent offered to send a replacement for the drinks, specifically one fresh Iced Buttercrème Spanish Latté, and the customer requested two drinks instead. A new order was created for tracking.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially raised a concern regarding the quality of their order, specifically that they received only one drink instead of two. The agent acknowledged the issue and offered to send a replacement. After some delays in communication, the customer was satisfied with the resolution, receiving a new order ID for tracking. The root cause of the issue appears to be a mix-up in the order fulfillment process, compounded by delays in customer service response.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,OOS,70,OOS,5395

",Outlet,OOS,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in receiving a promised refund for an order.  
Identified Problem: Lack of follow-through on the refund process after the customer was informed by a clerk that a refund would be issued.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication between the customer and the agent regarding the refund process.  
- The customer was unable to effectively communicate their issue due to language barriers and agent responses that did not address their concern.  
Resolution Offered: The agent acknowledged the issue and attempted to connect the customer with another agent for further assistance, but no concrete resolution was provided during the chat.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving a refund for an order where they were assured by a clerk that it would be processed. The main issue stemmed from a lack of clarity and communication regarding the refund process, compounded by language barriers that hindered effective interaction with the agent. The chat ended without a resolution, as the customer was not able to convey their issue clearly to the agent.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND STATUS,80,Refund Status,5055

Primary Concern: Invalid phone number and payment failure  
Identified Problem: The customer was unable to place an order due to an invalid phone number and a failed payment transaction.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer may have entered an incorrect phone number format or used a number not registered with ZUS Coffee.  
- The payment method used by the customer was unsuccessful, leading to order cancellation.  
Resolution Offered: The agent suggested considering alternative payment methods for future orders and informed the customer that the store was closed for the day.  
Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer, Hidayah, who faced issues with an invalid phone number and a failed payment transaction, preventing her from placing an order. The agent communicated that the payment was unsuccessful, resulting in order cancellation, and suggested alternative payment methods. Additionally, the store was closed, which further delayed the customer's ability to order. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of phone number registration issues and payment processing failures.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,75,CHANGE / UPDATE INFO,70,Change / Update Info,4933

Identified Problem: Lack of clear communication regarding customization options for bulk orders  
Contributing Factors:  
- Misunderstanding of the process for adding remarks to coffee cups  
- Potential lack of system functionality to accommodate specific requests like hiding prices on receipts  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the remarks would be communicated to the barista and agreed to hide the prices on the receipt.  
Overall Summary: The customer reached out to request personalized remarks on coffee cups for a bulk order placed through Grab Food. The agent facilitated the request by informing the barista and agreed to hide the prices on the receipt. The interaction was positive, but the underlying issue appears to be a lack of clarity in the process for customizing bulk orders, which could lead to confusion for customers in the future.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,75,COMPLAINTS,75,Complaints,3976

Primary Concern: Delay in order preparation and request for less sugar in the cafe latte  
Identified Problem: Order was not prepared within the expected timeframe (more than 15 minutes)

- Customer excitement led to oversight in applying the voucher  
- System policy does not allow for order amendments or cancellations once submitted

Despite understanding the policy that prevents order changes after submission, the customer sought assistance in receiving the discount retroactively. The agent reiterated that the customer must apply the voucher manually in future orders, leading to a resolution that did not meet the customer's expectations.

user: Hi, I have ordered 4 cups of coffee (as shown above) with ZUSB3F1 coupon. Upon arrival, I only received 3 cups. I did not receive one cup of flat white

Noted that the order label is written not printed as usual, I suspect the system in the outlet is down. 

Kindly check with outlet manager regarding this issue, as this is not the first time happened to me. The last time this happened, I was in the outlet so I was able to talk to the staff regarding the missing order. 

May I know if I am eligible for replacement or any coupons? 

Thank you so much.

Primary Concern: Invalid phone number preventing order cancellation  
Identified Problem: The customer's phone number is not recognized as registered in the ZUS Coffee system.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer provided a Singapore phone number, which may not be supported or recognized by the system.  
- The customer attempted to cancel an order that was already marked as ready for pickup, leading to a policy restriction on cancellations.

Overall Summary: The customer, Nicholas, faced an issue with an invalid phone number when trying to cancel an order. The agent explained that the phone number was not registered in the system, which may be due to the number being from Singapore.

Resolution Offered: The agent provided the driver's details and reiterated that the order could not be amended or canceled once it was being prepared.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being unable to cancel an order that was incorrectly placed.

Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery and cancellation request by the rider  
Identified Problem: The rider accepted the order but was unable to fulfill it due to location issues  
Contributing Factors:  
- The rider's location (Damansara) was too far from the order pickup point (Melawati Mall)  
- Miscommunication or lack of proper routing for the rider to accept orders outside their delivery range
