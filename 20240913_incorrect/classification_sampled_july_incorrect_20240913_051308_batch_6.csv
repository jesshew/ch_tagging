- The customer was not informed clearly about the refund process and the time it would take for the bank to reverse the funds.  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that they would need to wait for the transaction to decline for the funds to be reversed, and that the refund processing time depends on the bank.  
Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer who was frustrated about being double charged for a gift card transaction. The agent explained that the additional charge was pending and could not be canceled, requiring the customer to wait for the bank to decline the transaction for a refund. The root cause of the issue appears to be a miscommunication regarding the payment status and the refund process, leading to the customer's dissatisfaction.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,85,Double Payment Charges,5561

Primary Concern: Order cancellation and delivery issues  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding delivery service availability at the outlet  
Contributing Factors:  
- The outlet does not provide delivery services, only pickup, which was not clearly communicated to the customer.  
- The customer received a call from the store to cancel the order, indicating a lack of coordination between the app and the outlet.  
Resolution Offered: Refund processed to ZUS Balance and a 20% discount voucher as compensation.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced frustration due to an order cancellation after being informed by the rider that the outlet only offers pickup services, despite using the app for delivery. This miscommunication led to wasted time and dissatisfaction. The agent offered a refund and a discount voucher as compensation, addressing the customer's concerns, but the root cause remains the lack of clarity regarding service availability at the outlet.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,75,WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS - VOUCHER CODE,75,Wrong Outlet / Address - Voucher Code,5047

Primary Concern: Issues with top-up transactions not reflecting in the ZUS Coffee app despite bank confirmation of successful transactions.  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication or system error regarding the status of the top-up transactions.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer made two top-up attempts, one via online banking and another via e-wallet, but only one was acknowledged by the ZUS system.  
- The bank confirmed that the transactions were successful, but ZUS claimed they did not receive the funds.  
Resolution Offered: The agent submitted a refund request after confirming two valid transactions, one for a top-up and one for a gift card.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a top-up issue where funds were deducted from their bank account but not reflected in the ZUS Coffee app. Despite the bank confirming the transactions were successful, ZUS initially only acknowledged one transaction. After further investigation, the agent recognized two valid transactions and submitted a refund request.

Primary Concern: Unable to log in to the ZUS app

Contributing Factors:  
- The customer provided a phone number that was initially deemed invalid by the system.  
- The customer has already attempted to uninstall and reinstall the app without success.

Primary Concern: Reduced volume of CEO Latte drinks upon delivery  
Identified Problem: Inconsistent quality of drinks between in-store pickup and delivery  
Contributing Factors:  
- Thicker foam dissipating during delivery, leading to reduced liquid volume  
- Possible lack of quality control or training for delivery staff at the specific branch  
Resolution Offered: Refund via ZUS Balance (which the customer declined)  
Overall Summary: The customer raised a concern about receiving CEO Lattes with reduced volume during delivery compared to in-store pickup. The agent acknowledged the issue, explaining that the foam's dissipation during delivery was the cause. The customer expressed frustration with the delivery experience at that specific branch and requested better quality control rather than a refund.

user: Sure thing",Outlet,Wrong Order / Item(s),Customer,"Customer sentiment: Neutral  
Primary Concern: Scheduling an order delivery time  
Identified Problem: The order was already in the delivery process, preventing changes to the scheduled time.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer initially wanted to schedule their order for a specific time (2 PM) but was unable to do so because the order was already picked up by the rider.  
- The system does not allow for changes to confirmed orders once they are in the delivery process.  
Resolution Offered: The agent offered to assign riders for the customer's subsequent orders and confirmed that changes could not be made to the already confirmed order.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed a desire to schedule their order for a specific time but was informed that the order was already in delivery, which prevented any changes. The agent provided assistance by assigning riders for the customer's other orders and clarified the limitations of the system regarding order modifications. The root cause of the issue was the order being picked up for delivery before the customer could request a change in the scheduled time.",ORDER STATUS & TRACKING,75,DELIVERY INFO / STATUS,85,Delivery Info / Status,5140

Contributing Factors:  
- Possible packing error during order fulfillment

Overall Summary: The customer reported that a chocolate donut was missing from their order (ID: 24071523459). The agent acknowledged the issue and confirmed that the item was temporarily out of stock, leading to a packing error. After some back-and-forth communication, the agent arranged for a replacement donut to be delivered to the customer. The customer expressed satisfaction with the resolution and rated the service highly.

",Outlet,Wrong Order / Item(s),Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to amend an order after it has been placed

Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication regarding order amendment policies prior to placing the order  
- Possible system limitations that prevent order modifications after confirmation  
Resolution Offered: None; the agent informed the customer that amendments are not possible after order placement  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over the inability to modify their order after it was placed. The main issue stems from the company's policy that does not allow changes once a rider is assigned, which may not have been clearly communicated to the customer beforehand.

",Delivery,Failed Delivery,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer did not receive their order despite it showing as delivered.  
Identified Problem: The delivery was made to the wrong address, possibly due to an error in the address provided or miscommunication with the delivery service.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Incorrect street number in the address provided by the customer.  
- Potential inaccuracies in Google Maps affecting the delivery address.

",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Drink,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect beverage quantity received  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the ""less ice"" request leading to a lesser quantity of the drink  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer's misunderstanding of the ""less ice"" option affecting drink quantity  
- Lack of clarity in communication about how the ""less ice"" option impacts the overall beverage volume  
Resolution Offered: Refund of RM10.90 via ZUS Balance, with the option to contact the outlet manager for further assistance  
Overall Summary: The customer initially reported a spillage issue but later clarified that the problem was related to receiving a lesser quantity of their Iced Spanish Latt√©, which they attributed to a barista mistake. The agent explained that the ""less ice"" option would not reduce the drink's ingredients but acknowledged the customer's concern. A refund was offered as a resolution, and the customer was advised to contact the outlet manager for further confirmation. The root cause of the issue appears to be a misunderstanding of the implications of the ""less ice"" request and insufficient communication regarding the drink preparation process.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,FOAM ISSUE,75,Foam Issue,5979
