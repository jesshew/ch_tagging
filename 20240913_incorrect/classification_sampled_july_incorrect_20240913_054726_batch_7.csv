",Feedback / Improvement,App - OTP,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Neutral  
Primary Concern: The customer experienced an issue with a top-up transaction not reflecting in the app despite being deducted from their bank account.  
Identified Problem: A system error in the app that caused the transaction to show as rejected.  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error in the ZUS Coffee app leading to transaction failures.  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the nature of the transaction (top-up vs. order).  
Resolution Offered: The agent acknowledged the issue, confirmed that the top-up amount was eventually reflected in the customer's account, and apologized for the inconvenience caused.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced a problem where a RM10 top-up was deducted from their bank account but did not reflect in the ZUS Coffee app, showing as rejected instead. The agent struggled to understand the issue due to miscommunication and repeated requests for an order ID, which was not applicable. Eventually, the agent confirmed that a system issue was responsible for the error, and the customer’s top-up amount was successfully reflected in their account. The interaction highlighted a system error as the root cause of the issue.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,80,ZUS BALANCE WITHDRAWAL,70,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,6086

Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to an incorrect order or outlet.  
Identified Problem: The customer was unable to successfully communicate their request to cancel the order, leading to confusion and frustration.  
Contributing Factors:

- The system's automatic handling of order status and refunds may not have been clearly explained to the customer.

Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer, Luz Tang, who was trying to cancel an order due to it being incorrect. The agent struggled to understand the cancellation request, leading to repeated attempts by the customer to clarify their needs. The customer expressed frustration over the lack of clear communication and resolution.

Primary Concern: Delay in order preparation and inability to add remarks to the order  
Identified Problem: The order was not being prepared due to no rider being assigned, leading to a delay.  
Contributing Factors:

- Miscommunication regarding the ability to add remarks to the order after it was marked for delivery.  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that if a rider could not be found within 30 minutes, a refund would be processed to their ZUS Balance. However, they could not add remarks to the order as it was already for delivery.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a delay in their order, which was stuck in the ""allocating driver"" status for over 15 minutes, and was unable to add a remark for a sugar-free latte.

Contributing Factors:  
- System limitations in rider assignment  
- External circumstances (traffic jam) affecting rider availability

After multiple requests for cancellation, the agent successfully processed the cancellation and offered a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance.

user: Hi, just wanted to share a complaint about an outlet
agent: You may write the complaints here as we will forward this to the higher management.
user: I would like to bring to your attention an issue I experienced at your store today. I understand that there may be short staff and high order volumes, but my order was unfortunately incorrect twice.
user: This is the Curve outlet, today 31st july, approximately 12:50pm onwards
user: I ordered the iced white peach oolong milk tea with almond milk and paid an extra RM3 for this option. However, the first drink I received was coffee, and the second drink had fresh milk instead of almond milk.
agent: We really regret not being able to meet your expectations this time.
agent: We will highlight this to the outlet PIC to investigate and take necessary action to ensure this incident shall never happen in the future. 🙏
user: I was the only customer who was patiently waiting yea. I had to stand and watch how my drink was made to ensure it was correct. I kindly request that your staff be reminded to carefully read and prepare customer orders as specified. While I don't mind waiting, I believe accuracy should not be compromised.
agent: We are putting the highest priority on this issue and will forward it to the relevant team to check and take necessary action to prevent this from happening again.
agent: Once again, my deepest apologies on the inconvenience caused.
agent: Apart from that, is there anything else that I can assist you?
user: nothing much to add on, just wanna highlight that this mistake is significant not just for me, but for any customer with dietary restrictions or health concerns. It's not just about the extra RM3 I paid, though for some, RM3 is quite a significant amount. Thanks for your time and assistance. Hope this will be addressed yea. Have a good day.
agent: We will definitely highlight this to our PIC outlet.
agent: We apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Primary Concern: Incorrect order received at the outlet

- High order volumes and potential short staffing at the outlet  
- Lack of attention to detail by staff when preparing orders

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving the wrong order twice at the Curve outlet, specifically ordering an iced white peach oolong milk tea with almond milk but receiving coffee and fresh milk instead. The customer highlighted the importance of accuracy, especially for those with dietary restrictions, and requested that staff be reminded to carefully read orders. The agent acknowledged the issue, apologized, and promised to escalate the matter to management for resolution.

agent: For your inquiry regarding ZUS Coffee, please select the country you are interested in

user: Hi,

I want to make a complaint.

1. on 10/7/2024 I made a purchase at Zus Coffee Pertama Kompleks.

2. I made only 2 orders which are Iced Spanish Latte and Iced Australian Chocolate.

3. But the cashier key in 3 orders which are 1 Iced Spanish Latte and 2x Iced Spanish Chocolate.

4. The cashier has no coins left to return to the customer.

5. The distance from my office to Zus Coffee is not far, only from epf to the first complex.

6. As a result of the cup lid not being tight, water has spilled inside the motor box and I'm not angry but want to make sure next time make sure the lid is tight before giving it to the customer

7. It's just that I feel wrong because the water has just spilled in the motor basket.

Yours sincerely

Primary Concern: Customer unable to find the option to use a registered tumbler in the ZUS app.  
Identified Problem: Lack of visibility of the tumbler option in the app, despite the tumbler being registered.

Some of the ice cubes had melted.

Primary Concern: Delay in receiving the correct order and poor quality of the drinks  
Identified Problem: The initial rider did not collect the order, leading to a replacement order being necessary  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication between the rider and the outlet regarding order collection  
- Quality control issues with the drinks (latte served warm instead of hot)  
Resolution Offered: Replacement order provided with a new order number; assurance of reporting the rider's behavior  
Overall Summary: The customer, Sahidah Salleh, expressed frustration over a delay in receiving her coffee order, which was compounded by the poor quality of the drinks delivered. The initial rider failed to collect the order, leading to a replacement being issued. The customer also noted that the latte was not hot enough and had melted ice cubes. The agent assured the customer that the rider's behavior would be reported and emphasized the company's commitment to improving delivery service. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of miscommunication regarding order collection and quality control failures with the drinks.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,CANCELLATION - NO RIDER,75,Cancellation - No Rider,4639

Primary Concern: Missing coffee jelly and straws in multiple orders
