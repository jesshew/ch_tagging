Primary Concern: Order was auto-refunded due to no available rider

Contributing Factors:  
- System error or policy that triggers auto-refund when no rider is available  
- Possible high demand or low supply of riders at the time of the order  
Resolution Offered: Auto-refund processed due to unavailability of a rider  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over their order being auto-refunded because there was no rider available to fulfill it. The root cause appears to be a system policy that automatically cancels orders when riders are unavailable, potentially exacerbated by high demand or low rider availability.

Primary Concern: Missing Matcha Macam Sticker Pack from the order  
Identified Problem: The sticker pack was not included in the delivered order, leading to confusion about the delivery status.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the delivery address (customer's house number was incorrect in the system).  
- Possible oversight in order fulfillment, resulting in the sticker pack being omitted.  
Resolution Offered: Refund of the amount for the missing sticker pack to the customer's ZUS Balance.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially reported a missing Matcha Macam Sticker Pack from their order. After confirming the order details, it was found that the order was marked as delivered, but the customer had not received the item due to an incorrect address in the system. The agent offered a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance as a resolution. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of miscommunication regarding the delivery address and a potential oversight in the order fulfillment process.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,80,OOS,75,OOS,5438

",Customer Account Details,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Refund process after order cancellation  
Identified Problem: Auto-cancellation of the order due to unavailability of riders, leading to a refund to the ZUS wallet instead of the customer's bank account.  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error or policy that automatically refunds to ZUS wallet rather than bank account.  
- Lack of communication regarding the refund process and options available to the customer.  
Resolution Offered: The agent submitted a request for the refund to the customer's bank account, which will take 14 working days to process.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced frustration due to an order cancellation caused by the unavailability of riders, resulting in a refund to their ZUS wallet instead of their bank account. The customer expressed dissatisfaction with this policy, feeling it forced them to use the wallet again. The agent facilitated a refund request to the bank, which will take time to process, but the underlying issue appears to be a system policy that does not allow for direct bank refunds in such situations.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,INCORRECT REFUND AMOUNT / CHANNEL,85,Incorrect Refund Amount / Channel,5777

I would like express my dissatisfaction on how my case was handle.
This is my order ID: 24071637046. I reach out to your Customer Service
team immediately as soon as I realised that my delivery consist of
wrong item. What I expect was of course the most direct compensation
which is refund on the wrong item.
I ordered 4 drinks ( 1x Hot Cafe Latte, 1x Zirty Matcha Latte, 1x
Double Choc Chip Frappe & 1x Americano Bottle 1 Litre). I received the
paper bag with my name written on the bag and the paper bag was
stapled and sealed(Good Condition) so definitely would highlight this
issue has nothing to do with the driver, I believe it was a mistake
that the shop made while packing the order as upon opening my bag I
realise immediately 1 of the items is wrong because there was no
bottle inside obviously and I receive another cup of beverage which
wasn‚Äôt labelled and not something I ordered and the rest of the 3
drinks received were all correct except for that 1 drink. But after
reaching out to your team, i didn‚Äôt get any prompt response so I
assume that your Customer Service team is not real time as I‚Äôve sent
multiple explanations and supporting images of the case which I
encountered. After waiting for around 10minutes, I left the app as it
wasnt responsive and no notifications received ( The App is not user
friendly , not easy to navigate around and no notifications or updates
on my chat) but I left my email there mentioning to update me if there
is any decision made. After few hours I came back to the app to check
again to see if there was any updates. I checked and realised I‚Äôve
gotten responses and I was missed out on that and it mentioned that
they offer to deliver my missing order. However, I wasn‚Äôt online that
time when your team has responded. I‚Äôm unsatisfied on how my case was
close after that as I actually waited and also left my contact details
in case your team have came up with a solution for my case. But , in
the end it‚Äôs just close like that. I actually paid for the drinks but
I did not get what I paid for. I felt that my case wasn‚Äôt handle in a
proper manner. Therefore, I writing this email to demand on a refund
of the incorrect item I did not received which is Americano 1 Litre
Bottle. I hope to hear prompt response from your team. If require any
supporting attachments, feel free to reach back to me. Appreciate your
time in handling my matter. Thank You.

user: Then ask to top up some milk, they refused. Said SOP not allowed
user: If Zus coffee continue doing this thing, I will consider not drink Zus Coffee in future.
user: Then tell me Zus coffee tumbler is bigger than their cup, the tumbler also original from Zus coffee, how I know the tumbler size is bigger than original cup?
user: Telling me all the nonsense from the shop worker
user: I ordered I tumbler, but get in cup. Then when moving from cup to tumbler sure spill out

agent: Kindly let me check this with the outlet and will get back to you as soon as possible.

user: Check with outlet they tell you SOP again
user: 
user: Already chosen tumbler option but still put in Cup
user: Then this is SOP?
user: Then just ask add little bit more milk for me as my drinks is double shot, said cannot because my tumbler is bigger which is not follow SOP
user: But the tumbler was bought from.Zus Coffee
user: Even remarks I also written please give me more milk for my drinks
user: If Zus Coffee only train outlet to follow SOP without follow customer request, then why want to design a bigger size tumbler for us to purchase?
user: Some more I didn't ask for put in cup, I ask to put in tumbler and add little bit of milk in my drinks only
user: Telling me add milk need money, the drinks already cost RM12.90, add little bit milk is very expensive? Funny answer I got.
agent: As per our check with the outlet, your Zirty Latte was prepared according to our standard operating procedures. Please note that the standard cup size for a Zirty Latte is 16oz, while your tumbler is 20oz. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and the unpleasant experience you encountered.

agent: In this case, may we offer a 20% discount voucher for you?

agent: We truly appreciate your kind understanding on this matter.

user: Then this question should ask Zus coffee
user: Why tumbler want to make different size?
user: Then customer not allow to request a little bit more milk for double shot drinks?
user: And I choose tumbler option, why want to prepare in cup?
user: Pouring here and there then split out count customer fault?
user: I think 20% discount is too less to solve this issue.
user: This makes me really angry from the outlet response
agent: The barista prepared the drink in the standard cup to measure the serving size accurately before pouring it into your tumbler.

user: This is not my fault, first tumbler is not me design, second the SOP set too strict, third the outlet didn't follow instruction to prepare in tumbler
user: OK, so I have to pour the drinks into the tumbler myself, if split out is my problem?
user: Do you think this is fair for me?
user: During the drinks move to tumbler, the coffee split out a lot.
user: Then request to add back a bit milk only, is it too over?
user: I believe all outlet should have the measuring cup to prepare the drinks right? No necessary to prepare in the plastic cup and waste for the cup, then customer have to pour back to tumbler. Don't you think all these are extra works?
user: Tumbler is mean to save plastic cup, but what I see is wasting plastic cup, then some more customer have to move it to tumbler, waste coffee when spill out.
user: Then tumbler is not serving the purpose you know?

- The customer provided multiple variations of the order ID, but none were accepted by the system.  
- There may be a miscommunication or misunderstanding regarding the format of the order ID required for cancellation.  
Resolution Offered: The agent attempted to assist the customer but ultimately could not process the cancellation due to the order ID issue. The customer was informed that vouchers cannot be added after the order is submitted.  
Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer trying to cancel an order due to an incorrect order or outlet. The main issue stemmed from the order ID not being recognized by the agent, leading to frustration for the customer. Despite multiple attempts to provide the correct order ID, the cancellation could not be processed, and the customer was also informed that they could not apply a coupon after the order was placed. The root cause appears to be a system error or miscommunication regarding the order ID format.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,80,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,5337

agent: The ZUS Coffee Referral Program is a program that rewards existing ZUS App users for referring their friends to the app.

When a friend signs up using a referral code and makes their first in-app purchase, both the referrer and the friend receive reward vouchers.

You can earn discount vouchers based on your member level and the number of successful referrals you have.

The higher your member level and the more successful referrals you make, the better discount vouchers you can receive.

When your friends sign up with your referral code, they will have to make their first in-app purchase to be entitled to the ZUS app referee journey.

Here are the vouchers that your friend can unlock progressively:
1. 60% OFF Top Picks
2. Buy 1 and get 50% OFF
3. Ultimate voucher pack

Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that the referral code can only be used by first-time users and cannot be updated.

",Order Info / Status,Missed Out - Order,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect order received and missing items  
Identified Problem: Order fulfillment error leading to missing items (Matcha Strawberry Latt√© and sugar sachet)  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication during order preparation  
- Lack of available delivery personnel for replacement orders  
Resolution Offered: Replacement order sent free of charge; refund initiated for the cancelled order  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced an issue with their order where they received the wrong item (only a caffe latte instead of the Matcha Strawberry Latt√©) and did not receive the requested sugar sachets. The customer expressed frustration, particularly as this affected their sister emotionally. The agent offered to send a replacement order at no cost due to the customer's financial concerns. However, the replacement order was later cancelled due to a lack of available delivery personnel, leading to a refund process that the customer did not see reflected in their account. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of order fulfillment errors and logistical challenges in delivery.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,OOS,70,OOS,7952

Contributing Factors:  
- The customer provided a phone number that does not match the registered number in the system.  
- The customer may have entered the phone number incorrectly or is using a number that is not registered with the coffee chain.  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer about the need to pay for packaging and confirmed that the order would be prepared as per the requests.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced an issue with their phone number not being recognized, which hindered their ability to confirm their order. After some back-and-forth regarding the phone number, the conversation shifted to the specifics of the order, including packaging and customization requests. The agent provided information about the packaging fee and assured the customer that their requests would be communicated to the barista. The root cause of the issue was the unregistered phone number, which led to initial frustration for the customer.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,85,CHANGE / UPDATE INFO,80,Change / Update Info,4773

Primary Concern: Missing sticker pack from the order  
Identified Problem: The order was marked as delivered, but the customer did not receive the sticker pack due to a possible address error.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer‚Äôs house number was incorrectly recorded as 12 instead of 17.  
- The customer suggested an alternative delivery location (Ipoh Fatt Enterprise) which could not be amended in the system.  
Resolution Offered: A refund to the customer's ZUS Balance was provided as the sticker pack could not be resent to the correct address.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially reported that the Matcha Macam sticker pack was missing from their order, which was marked as delivered. Upon investigation, it was revealed that the address was incorrectly recorded. The customer requested a resend to a different location, but this was not possible, leading to a refund being issued to their ZUS Balance.

- Possible system error or oversight in order preparation and packaging  
Resolution Offered: Refund of the missing item (Mushroom Chicken Deluxe) to the customer's ZUS balance  
Overall Summary: The customer initially raised a concern about a missing item from their order (ID: 24080104810). The agent acknowledged the issue and requested the order ID and images of the received items for further assistance. After some confusion regarding the order ID, the agent eventually processed a refund for the missing item. The customer expressed appreciation for the support received and confirmed the refund was received, indicating a positive resolution despite the initial frustration. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of miscommunication regarding the order ID and potential errors in order fulfillment.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,80,OOS,75,OOS,5203

436368,"Hi There,

I would like to lodge an official complaint towards ZUS Coffee branch The
Flo Damansara. I had made an order at 14.57pm, 3rd July 2024. Order ID
24070324772. Basically I did not receive the order and drinks and claim as
the order is sent. RM38.90, in total 4 drinks is not a big amount but yet
doing business, for me as a consumer, is cheating. The driver called me
coincidently I was in a meeting which had passed the call. I got my staff
to call back right away, however the answer he got from the driver was
""call no pick up"" and ""don't know where it's located"", so the order was
sent back to the store.

I am clearly written about the special remark on my shop name and which
floor. My other concern is, if it is sent back to the store, why did I not
receive any call or notification from the store to notify me and arrange
for pick up? Is this how Zus Coffee trains all the staff and causes this
type of trouble?

Basically I am from the service line as well. I feel it is not right if
this is how Zus coffee handles this type of case or order. yet I have
given a few attempts for a call but it is ""user busy"" at all the time.  It
is totally without responsibility for customer care.

I hope I can get an explanation from you all regarding this case by 1pm
tomorrow and kindly make a refund for this order.  Else I will officially
lodge a complaint to KPDN and contact my current officer to visit the store
in Zus Coffee @ The Flo Damansara.

Attach with the proof of order for reference.

Thank you.

Primary Concern: Delay in restocking vegan milk at the outlet  
Identified Problem: Lack of availability of vegan milk for three days at the specified outlet  
Contributing Factors:  
- Communication issues between the customer and the agent regarding the specific request  
- Possible supply chain or inventory management issues at the outlet  
Resolution Offered: The agent indicated that the relevant team is working to restock the item but did not provide a specific timeline for resolution.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over the unavailability of vegan milk at the Tower 8 and Horizon 2 outlets for three days. The agent struggled to understand the customer's request initially, leading to miscommunication. The root cause appears to be a supply chain issue affecting the availability of vegan milk, compounded by ineffective communication during the chat.

Primary Concern: Delay in restocking a specific cake option at the franchise  
Identified Problem: Lack of communication regarding stock availability and delays in restocking
