",Customer Account Details,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Refund process after order cancellation  
Identified Problem: Auto-cancellation of the order due to unavailability of riders, leading to a refund to the ZUS wallet instead of the customer's bank account.  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error or policy that automatically refunds to ZUS wallet rather than bank account.  
- Lack of communication regarding the refund process and options available to the customer.  
Resolution Offered: The agent submitted a request for the refund to the customer's bank account, which will take 14 working days to process.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced frustration due to an order cancellation caused by the unavailability of riders, resulting in a refund to their ZUS wallet instead of their bank account. The customer expressed dissatisfaction with this policy, feeling it forced them to use the wallet again. The agent facilitated a refund request to the bank, which will take time to process, but the underlying issue appears to be a system policy that does not allow for direct bank refunds in such situations.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,INCORRECT REFUND AMOUNT / CHANNEL,85,Incorrect Refund Amount / Channel,5777

Primary Concern: Inability to apply a voucher to an already prepared order  
Identified Problem: The system does not allow for order amendments once the order is prepared, leading to customer dissatisfaction.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication regarding voucher application during the ordering process  
- Absence of a reminder or prompt for voucher usage before finalizing the order  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that the voucher could be used for the next purchase, but the customer indicated that the voucher would expire before that.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being unable to apply a voucher to their order after it had been prepared. The main issue stemmed from the system's inability to amend orders post-preparation and a lack of reminders for voucher application during the checkout process. The customer suggested improvements for the app to prevent similar issues in the future, but ultimately felt dissatisfied due to the voucher's expiration.",LOYALTY AND REWARDS,85,APP - LOYALTY ISSUE,75,App - Loyalty Issue,4965

Primary Concern: Received the wrong item in the order  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication or error in order preparation leading to incorrect item being sent  
Contributing Factors:  
- High volume of inquiries causing delays in response and resolution  
- Repeated requests for information leading to customer frustration  
Resolution Offered: Refund to ZUS Balance or resend the correct drink  
Overall Summary: The customer, Muniza Mohd, expressed frustration over receiving the wrong item in her order (Matcha strawberry latte with regular sugar instead of less sugar and French vanilla). The interaction revealed issues with order preparation and communication, as the customer had to repeat her concerns multiple times due to the agent's inability to understand her requests. After several attempts to resolve the issue, the agent offered a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance, which was accepted. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of order fulfillment errors and inadequate communication during the customer service interaction.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,WRONG ORDER / ITEM(S),85,Wrong Order / Item(s),7299

I would like express my dissatisfaction on how my case was handle.
This is my order ID: 24071637046. I reach out to your Customer Service
team immediately as soon as I realised that my delivery consist of
wrong item. What I expect was of course the most direct compensation
which is refund on the wrong item.
I ordered 4 drinks ( 1x Hot Cafe Latte, 1x Zirty Matcha Latte, 1x
Double Choc Chip Frappe & 1x Americano Bottle 1 Litre). I received the
paper bag with my name written on the bag and the paper bag was
stapled and sealed(Good Condition) so definitely would highlight this
issue has nothing to do with the driver, I believe it was a mistake
that the shop made while packing the order as upon opening my bag I
realise immediately 1 of the items is wrong because there was no
bottle inside obviously and I receive another cup of beverage which
wasn’t labelled and not something I ordered and the rest of the 3
drinks received were all correct except for that 1 drink. But after
reaching out to your team, i didn’t get any prompt response so I
assume that your Customer Service team is not real time as I’ve sent
multiple explanations and supporting images of the case which I
encountered. After waiting for around 10minutes, I left the app as it
wasnt responsive and no notifications received ( The App is not user
friendly , not easy to navigate around and no notifications or updates
on my chat) but I left my email there mentioning to update me if there
is any decision made. After few hours I came back to the app to check
again to see if there was any updates. I checked and realised I’ve
gotten responses and I was missed out on that and it mentioned that
they offer to deliver my missing order. However, I wasn’t online that
time when your team has responded. I’m unsatisfied on how my case was
close after that as I actually waited and also left my contact details
in case your team have came up with a solution for my case. But , in
the end it’s just close like that. I actually paid for the drinks but
I did not get what I paid for. I felt that my case wasn’t handle in a
proper manner. Therefore, I writing this email to demand on a refund
of the incorrect item I did not received which is Americano 1 Litre
Bottle. I hope to hear prompt response from your team. If require any
supporting attachments, feel free to reach back to me. Appreciate your
time in handling my matter. Thank You.

The main issue stemmed from the order ID not being recognized by the agent, leading to frustration for the customer. Despite multiple attempts to provide the correct order ID, the cancellation could not be processed, and the customer was also informed that they could not apply a coupon after the order was placed. The root cause appears to be a system error or miscommunication regarding the order ID format.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,80,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,5337

agent: The ZUS Coffee Referral Program is a program that rewards existing ZUS App users for referring their friends to the app.

When a friend signs up using a referral code and makes their first in-app purchase, both the referrer and the friend receive reward vouchers.

You can earn discount vouchers based on your member level and the number of successful referrals you have.

The higher your member level and the more successful referrals you make, the better discount vouchers you can receive.

When your friends sign up with your referral code, they will have to make their first in-app purchase to be entitled to the ZUS app referee journey.

Here are the vouchers that your friend can unlock progressively:
1. 60% OFF Top Picks
2. Buy 1 and get 50% OFF
3. Ultimate voucher pack

",Order Info / Status,Missed Out - Order,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect order received and missing items  
Identified Problem: Order fulfillment error leading to missing items (Matcha Strawberry Latté and sugar sachet)  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication during order preparation  
- Lack of available delivery personnel for replacement orders  
Resolution Offered: Replacement order sent free of charge; refund initiated for the cancelled order  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced an issue with their order where they received the wrong item (only a caffe latte instead of the Matcha Strawberry Latté) and did not receive the requested sugar sachets. The customer expressed frustration, particularly as this affected their sister emotionally. The agent offered to send a replacement order at no cost due to the customer's financial concerns. However, the replacement order was later cancelled due to a lack of available delivery personnel, leading to a refund process that the customer did not see reflected in their account. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of order fulfillment errors and logistical challenges in delivery.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,OOS,70,OOS,7952

Primary Concern: The customer did not receive their drink despite being charged and the order showing as delivered.  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the delivery status and the driver's actions.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The driver claimed to have called the customer but reported that there was no response, leading to the order being marked as completed.  
- The customer asserts that they did answer the driver's call, which was about a motorbike issue, not an inability to reach them.  
Resolution Offered: A refund was issued to the customer's ZUS Balance, and the agent assured that the incident would be investigated.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being charged for a drink that was never delivered, despite the order status indicating completion.

Primary Concern: Inability to add remarks to an already placed order  
Identified Problem: The order had already been picked up by the rider, preventing any modifications  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer forgot to add remarks at the time of ordering  
- Lack of a clear process for modifying orders after they are placed and before they are picked up  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that modifications could not be made as the order was already with the rider  
Overall Summary: The customer initially sought to add a remark to their coffee order after realizing they forgot to do so. However, the order had already been picked up by the rider, which prevented any changes from being made. The interaction concluded with the customer accepting the situation and expressing satisfaction with the service despite the inability to modify the order. The root cause of the issue appears to be the timing of the order modification request relative to the order's status.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,75,PICKUP / DELIVERY MISTAKES,75,Pickup / Delivery Mistakes,4694
436368,"Hi There,

I would like to lodge an official complaint towards ZUS Coffee branch The
Flo Damansara. I had made an order at 14.57pm, 3rd July 2024. Order ID
24070324772. Basically I did not receive the order and drinks and claim as
the order is sent. RM38.90, in total 4 drinks is not a big amount but yet
doing business, for me as a consumer, is cheating. The driver called me
coincidently I was in a meeting which had passed the call. I got my staff
to call back right away, however the answer he got from the driver was
""call no pick up"" and ""don't know where it's located"", so the order was
sent back to the store.

I am clearly written about the special remark on my shop name and which
floor. My other concern is, if it is sent back to the store, why did I not
receive any call or notification from the store to notify me and arrange
for pick up? Is this how Zus Coffee trains all the staff and causes this
type of trouble?

Basically I am from the service line as well. I feel it is not right if
this is how Zus coffee handles this type of case or order. yet I have
given a few attempts for a call but it is ""user busy"" at all the time.  It
is totally without responsibility for customer care.

I hope I can get an explanation from you all regarding this case by 1pm
tomorrow and kindly make a refund for this order.  Else I will officially
lodge a complaint to KPDN and contact my current officer to visit the store
in Zus Coffee @ The Flo Damansara.

Attach with the proof of order for reference.

Thank you.

Karmen Khoo

Primary Concern: Non-delivery of order and lack of communication from the store  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication between the delivery driver and the customer, leading to the order being returned to the store without proper notification

very surprised. Because it was too sweet. This was not the CEO I usually
drink. The barista put condensed milk, so it was not what I ordered. I was

- Potential preparation or serving issue at the outlet that caused the cream to dissolve.  
Resolution Offered: Clarification that the velvet cream was included but dissolved, and an apology for the oversight.  
Overall Summary: The customer raised a concern about not receiving the velvet cream in their iced dark oolong cham latte. After some back and forth, it was clarified that the cream was included but had dissolved into the drink, which led to the misunderstanding. The agent apologized for the oversight and provided clarification, resolving the customer's query. The root cause appears to be a combination of miscommunication and a possible preparation issue at the outlet.",ORDER ACCURACY,75,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,85,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,5619
