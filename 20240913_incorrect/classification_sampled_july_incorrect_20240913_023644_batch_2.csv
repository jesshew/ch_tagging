",Cancellation,Cancellation - No Rider,Pandago,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to get orders delivered due to lack of available drivers

Contributing Factors:

Primary Concern: Repeated spillage issues due to poor quality packing material

- Frequent occurrence of the issue (customer mentions it happens daily)  
- Lack of effective communication regarding mitigation plans from the company

Primary Concern: Missing item from the order (Matcha Strawberry Latté)  
Identified Problem: System issues leading to a lack of synchronization with the outlet system, causing delays and miscommunication regarding the order.  
Contributing Factors:  
- High volume of customer inquiries leading to delayed responses.  
- Ongoing technical issues affecting order processing and fulfillment.  
Resolution Offered: A 20% discount voucher for the next purchase, but no free delivery coupon could be provided.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a missing item from their order, specifically a Matcha Strawberry Latté. The agent initially offered a refund, which the customer rejected, insisting on a replacement instead to avoid additional delivery charges. Due to ongoing technical issues, the agent was unable to guarantee a timely replacement before the customer's specified time. Ultimately, a 20% discount voucher was offered as compensation, but the customer felt that the resolution was inadequate given the circumstances. The root cause of the issue stemmed from system errors and high inquiry volumes, leading to miscommunication and delays in service.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,OOS,80,OOS,15574

",Payment,Payment Error / Failure,Payment Gateway,"Customer sentiment: Neutral  
Primary Concern: Confirmation of a top-up transaction  
Identified Problem: Lack of immediate confirmation or acknowledgment of the top-up by the agent  
Contributing Factors:  
- Delayed response times from the agent due to handling multiple inquiries  
- Initial lack of clarity regarding the status of the top-up transaction  
Resolution Offered: Confirmation that the RM45 has been successfully credited to the customer's ZUS wallet  
Overall Summary: The customer inquired about a top-up of RM45 and experienced delays in receiving confirmation. The agent eventually confirmed that the amount was credited to the customer's wallet, but the initial lack of prompt acknowledgment may have caused confusion. The root cause of the issue appears to be the agent's workload and the resulting delays in communication.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,80,ZUS BALANCE WITHDRAWAL,60,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,3863

Overall Summary: The customer initially expressed concern about forgetting to apply a voucher for their order and requested a cancellation. The agent facilitated the cancellation and refund, enabling the customer to reorder with the voucher.

438682,"user: Hello there, I'm at your Taipan outlet right now and I'm extremely displeased with the entire experience here. I wanted to get Zus Lemonade with a Boss shot in it and no sugar, but the baristas kept insisting on getting the Thunder (Which has honey in it). Despite insisting on a Lemonade with coffee, they keep insisting they'd make a Thunder cause it's the same thing. It definitely is not, the honey is way too sweet, and there's a reason there's a difference between the Zus Lemonade and the Honey Lemon on the menu. I went back to the counter to ask, and they said the normal lemonade has honey in it already cause it's standard procedure. I just had my Zus Lemonade with coffee in it and no added sugar at the Starling mall just a couple of days ago and it was great. What on earth is the 8 people working at the Taipan outlet doing??
user: The coffee is disgustingly sweet, and I have to pay money for the barista to not give me what I want and insist on making it another way??

agent: May we get a receipt and a picture of the drink for us to assist further?
user: 
user: Here you go, I'm still sitting here, extremely angry and disgusted by the drink. and the fact that we spent so long going back and forth with the barista about how it's not the same when we were ordering. but they kept pushing that the Thunder is the same thing and that they all have honey in it
user: Thank you for looking into this
user: We also told them to not put sugar in it, but they gave us regular sugar
user: my friend ordered a coconut coffee with less sugar, but they keyed in and even wrote on his cup to put in extra sugar
user: the team behind the counter just keeps chit chatting and laughing, at least they should do their jobs correctly but instead they're doing the exact opposite

Primary Concern: Invalid phone number preventing refund processing  
Identified Problem: The customer's phone number is not recognized as registered in the ZUS Coffee system.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer was informed that the Watermelon Berry Refresher was out of stock, leading to a refund request.  
- The customer repeatedly provided the same phone number, which the system did not accept as valid.  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the refund had been processed to the customer's ZUS Balance and advised checking the app.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced an issue with an out-of-stock item, leading to a refund request. However, the main issue arose when the customer attempted to confirm the refund, only to be met with repeated invalid phone number notifications. This indicates a potential system error or miscommunication regarding the registration of the customer's phone number, contributing to the customer's frustration. The agent did offer a resolution by confirming the refund had been processed, but the ongoing phone number issue remained unresolved during the interaction.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,85,ZUS BALANCE WITHDRAWAL,75,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,7901

",Delivery,Slow Delivery Service,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to an incorrect order/outlet issue.  
Identified Problem: The system's inability to cancel the order once a rider is assigned, despite the rider not being assigned at the time of the customer's request.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer was informed that the order was not yet being prepared due to no rider being assigned initially, leading to confusion.  
- Miscommunication regarding the status of the order and the rider assignment process.  
Resolution Offered: The agent stated that the system would automatically refund the order if a rider could not be found within 30 minutes, but did not facilitate the cancellation directly.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over wanting to cancel an order due to it being incorrect. The main issue stemmed from the system's policy that prevents cancellations once a rider is assigned, despite the customer being told that no rider was assigned at the time of their request. This led to confusion and dissatisfaction with the service. The agent provided information about the rider but did not resolve the cancellation request directly.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,80,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,5181

Primary Concern: Double payment deduction from the customer's bank account  
Identified Problem: The customer experienced a double deduction for a single order, leading to confusion and frustration.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer initially attempted to pay with one bank account and then used another, which may have caused confusion regarding the transaction status.  
- The agent's system only showed one transaction captured, which may indicate a potential system error or miscommunication regarding the payment processing.  
Resolution Offered: The agent assured the customer that the floating amount would be refunded within 14 working days, pending verification of the double deduction.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Aisyah, contacted support regarding a double payment for her order (ID: 24071737875). After some back and forth, the agent confirmed that only one transaction was recorded on their end, but assured Aisyah that any excess charge would be refunded within 14 working days.

Primary Concern: Invalid phone number registration and poor quality of the espresso frappe  
Identified Problem: The customer's phone number is not registered in the system, preventing them from accessing their account. Additionally, the quality of the espresso frappe was unsatisfactory due to ice chunks.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer may have entered an incorrect phone number or the number may not be registered in the system.  
- Quality control issues at the outlet regarding the preparation of the espresso frappe.

",Payment,Payment Error / Failure,Payment Gateway,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Double payment for an order  
Identified Problem: Initial payment was deducted but not processed correctly, leading to a second payment being made.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The app displayed 'pending payment' and did not show an order number after the initial payment.  
- The customer was unable to contact the bank to verify the initial payment due to bank operation hours.  
Resolution Offered: The agent will follow up with the payment team and reach out to the customer via mobile or email for further updates.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a double payment issue for their order, stating that the initial payment was deducted but not reflected in the app, prompting a second payment. The agent confirmed only one payment was received and suggested the customer check with the bank. The root cause appears to be a miscommunication or error in the payment processing system, compounded by the app's failure to display the correct order status. The agent assured the customer that the issue would be escalated to the payment team for resolution.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,90,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,90,Double Payment Charges,5526

",Feedback / Improvement,App - OTP,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Loss of access to account with balance due to terminated phone number  
Identified Problem: Inability to recover account access due to the old phone number being terminated  
Contributing Factors:  
- The old phone number was associated with an account that the customer could no longer access.  
- The new phone number was already registered to another account, complicating the recovery process.  
Resolution Offered: The agent successfully updated the customer's phone number to regain access to the account.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced frustration due to losing access to their account associated with a terminated phone number, which contained a balance. The issue stemmed from the inability to verify the account due to the old number being inactive and the new number being linked to another account. After several interactions, the agent was able to update the phone number, allowing the customer to regain access to their account.
