- Lack of proactive communication regarding order status  
Resolution Offered: 20% discount voucher for the next purchase  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over an extended waiting period for their order, which took over an hour without updates. The agent informed the customer that the order was not being prepared due to no rider being assigned. The customer also noted that the drink received was not hot, further contributing to dissatisfaction. As a resolution, the agent offered a 20% discount voucher for future purchases. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of system inefficiencies in rider assignment and inadequate communication regarding the order status.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,SLOW RIDER ALLOCATION,85,Slow Rider Allocation,5687

Subject: ISU TIADA RIDER & PEMULANGAN WANG
To: <zcm-support@zuscoffee.com>


Hello Zuss Team,

Saya ada pertanyaan mengenai pemulangan duit (Zuss Balance).
Saya buat pembelian menggunakan Aplikasi Zuss dan membayar menggunakan Zuss
Balance pada 05/07/2024, Order Number : 24070504911. Order Type : Delivery,
Item : Vietnamese Spanish Latte & Iced OATSIDE Japanese Genmaicha Latte,
Jumlah Pembelian : RM30.80.

Saya tidak menerima pesanan minuman kerana tiada Rider. Saya menerima notis
'Refunded' tetapi saya tidak menerima sebarang pemulangan wang sebanyak
RM30.80.

Saya mohon pihak Zuss menyemak Zuss Balance dan isu pemulangan wang saya.

Di sini saya kepilkan bukti pembelian.

Sekian,
Terima Kasih.

",Cancellation,Cancellation - No Rider,Pandago,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Refund not received for a failed delivery  
Identified Problem: Lack of delivery rider leading to order cancellation  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error or miscommunication regarding rider availability  
- Delay in processing the refund to the customer's Zuss Balance  
Resolution Offered: Request for the Zuss team to check the Zuss Balance and resolve the refund issue  
Overall Summary: The customer, Ain Amir, expressed frustration over not receiving a refund for an order that was not delivered due to the absence of a delivery rider. Despite receiving a notification that the order was refunded, the customer did not see the amount reflected in their Zuss Balance. The root cause appears to be a combination of a system error or miscommunication regarding rider availability and a delay in processing the refund. The customer requested assistance in resolving the issue.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND ERROR / FAILURE,85,Refund Error / Failure,4416

",Order Info / Status,Missed Out - Order,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Appreciative  
Primary Concern: Missing sticker pack from the order  
Identified Problem: The customer did not receive the sticker pack they ordered, which was not included in the original order.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the items ordered (customer believed they ordered a sticker pack).  
- Potential oversight in the order fulfillment process at the outlet.  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed the issue and provided a new order ID for the resend of the sticker pack (24070107746).  
Overall Summary: The customer initially raised a concern about missing items from their order, specifically a sticker pack. After some back and forth, it was clarified that the sticker pack was not part of the original order. The agent promptly addressed the issue by resending the sticker pack and provided a new order ID for tracking. The interaction concluded positively, with the customer expressing gratitude for the prompt action taken. The root cause of the issue appears to be a miscommunication regarding the items ordered and a possible oversight in the fulfillment process.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,80,OOS,70,OOS,5203

When I went down, the order was no where to be found. Grab driver said it's SOP to ensure item is passed or contact customer - this is the first time I heard if can't contact will return to branch. Usually Grab driver will inform via WhatsApp or anything and leave the item on table. I was infuriated cuz I was scolded by the Grab guy. Adding on the ZUS app shared a successful order and have to go through so many steps for customer service, aka inefficient use of time. Our team is hungry and my boss is frustrated there's no coffee.

 Dear Zus,  
  I hope this email finds you well. I am one of your customers, and I would like to address my disappointment regarding my recent orders. Yesterday, 16/07/2024 at 19:27 , I ordered matcha along with a free sticker. However, upon collecting my order, I did not receive the Matcham Matcha sticker as expected. When I inquired with the staff, they informed me that there was no record of a free sticker in their system. This has now occurred twice , first one happened on 29 June 2024 , 16:56. I had address my complain in Zus App . As a cat lover, it is quite disappointing to me. I kindly request that you look into this matter promptly. 
   
  Best regards, 
  Nur Alia Bt Abu Samah

",Order Info / Status,Missed Out - Order,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Missing items from the order (CEO Latté and Tom Yum Chicken Puff)  
Identified Problem: Incomplete order fulfillment leading to missing items  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of communication from the outlet regarding the missing items  
- Possible errors in order preparation and packing

The agent acknowledged the issue and escalated it to the outlet but received no response, preventing re-delivery of the items. Instead, a refund was offered and processed to the customer's ZUS balance.

Primary Concern: Difficulty in placing an order for a bottled caffe latte with no sugar option  
Identified Problem: Lack of a no sugar option on the Food Panda platform for the customer's order  
Contributing Factors:  
- The preset options on Food Panda only allow for ""less sugar"" instead of ""no sugar.""  
- The customer is diabetic and requires a specific order modification that is not available in the app.  
Resolution Offered: The agent notified the outlet of the customer's request for no sugar in the order.  
Overall Summary: The customer reached out to the coffee chain's support to express difficulty in placing an order for a bottled caffe latte without sugar due to the limitations of the Food Panda app. The agent facilitated communication with the outlet to ensure the customer's request was noted. The primary issue stemmed from the lack of a no sugar option on the ordering platform, which could potentially affect customers with dietary restrictions. The interaction concluded with the customer feeling acknowledged and hopeful for the correct order delivery.",GENERAL INQUIRY / PRODUCT INQUIRY,70,PRODUCT / MENU DETAILS,85,Product / Menu Details,4531

Primary Concern: Extended waiting period for order delivery

- System error or inefficiency in rider assignment  
- Lack of clear communication regarding order status and cancellation policy

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over an order that had been pending for over two hours without a rider being assigned. Despite the automated system stating that the order would be canceled if a rider was not found within 30 minutes, the order remained active. The agent eventually confirmed that a refund had been processed, but the prolonged wait and lack of communication contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction.

I hope this email finds you well.

I am a dedicated fan of Zus Coffee and have very much enjoyed your drinks
without any issues. I recently ordered the new Dark Oolong Cham Coffee from
your menu. I loved the drink, it tasted amazing  as always.


However, I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning incident that
occured with my recent order.

Today, I have placed an order for a drink but I have received unsettling
text messages from a rider who had access to my personal number. Hence,
this has made me feel very uncomfortable.



This is a violation of my privacy and it should not happen to other Zus
customers as well.

I kindly request that you take appropriate action to this rider's behaviour
that such incidents shall not happen again in the future. I would
appreciate it if you could look into this matter and address it
accordingly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Lysa Almazan
