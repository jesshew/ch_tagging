Primary Concern: Delay in receiving a refund for an unavailable cake order  
Identified Problem: The cakes ordered were out of stock, and the refund process took longer than expected.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of timely communication regarding the refund status  
- Possible system or process delays in processing refunds  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the refund was processed to the customer's ZUS Balance and that the voucher would also be returned to the customer's account.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a delayed refund for two cakes that were unavailable after payment was made using a birthday voucher. The outlet informed the customer that HQ would handle the refund, but after three days, the customer had not received it. The agent eventually confirmed that the refund had been processed to the customer's ZUS Balance and that the voucher would be returned, addressing the customer's concerns. The root cause of the issue appears to be a delay in the refund process and communication regarding the status of the refund.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND STATUS,85,Refund Status,5407

Primary Concern: The customer received a drink that was not sweet as expected.  
Identified Problem: The barista may have forgotten to add syrup or sugar to the drink.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer has experienced this issue before, indicating a potential recurring problem with drink preparation at the outlet.  
- The customer was unable to contact the outlet directly due to its closing time, which limited their options for resolution.  
Resolution Offered: A refund of RM12.90 was processed to the customer's ZUS balance as compensation.  
Overall Summary: The customer reported that their second drink order was not sweet, suggesting that the barista may have forgotten to add syrup. Despite the customer having a previous similar experience, the agent offered a refund instead of a drink replacement. The customer expressed frustration over the recurring issue and hoped for better consistency in drink preparation at the outlet. The root cause appears to be a lapse in drink preparation standards at the outlet.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,85,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,5864

",Delivery,Rider Behavior,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery due to unavailability of a rider  
Identified Problem: System failure to assign a rider in a timely manner  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer experienced a waiting time exceeding 15 minutes without a rider being assigned.  
- The system's auto-refund policy may indicate a lack of available riders or operational inefficiencies.

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a delay in their order due to the unavailability of a rider, leading to a waiting time that exceeded 15 minutes. The root cause appears to be a system failure in assigning a rider promptly.

Primary Concern: Incorrect order location leading to inability to cancel the order  
Identified Problem: The customer selected the wrong outlet for their order, which was already prepared, preventing cancellation.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding outlet names and their order processing system  
- Lack of clarity in the app regarding outlet selection, leading to confusion

Overall Summary: The customer initially faced an issue with ordering from the wrong outlet, which led to frustration when they were unable to cancel the order after it was prepared. The agent explained that cancellations are not possible once an order is prepared, but after further discussion, a one-time exception was made to process a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance. The customer expressed dissatisfaction with the outlet naming convention in the app, suggesting that state names should precede outlet names to avoid future confusion.

",Outlet,OOS,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Missing promotional sticker from order  
Identified Problem: Barista overlooked the inclusion of the free sticker due to a system error and stock unavailability.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the availability of the promotional item (sticker).  
- Technical outage that led to the sticker being incorrectly listed as included in the order.  
Resolution Offered: Refund for the affected orders and a 20% voucher as a token of apology, which the customer declined in favor of a refund.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving a free promotional sticker that was supposed to be included with their order. The issue stemmed from a barista's oversight and a technical error that misrepresented the sticker's availability. The customer also faced a spillage issue with another order, leading to further dissatisfaction. The agent offered a refund and a voucher, but the customer preferred a direct refund. The interaction highlighted significant miscommunication and service failures, contributing to the customer's negative experience.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,75,MISSED OUT - REMARKS,75,Missed Out - Remarks,10741

- Inadequate communication and follow-up from customer service agents  
Resolution Offered: Request for images of the affected items for further assessment  
Overall Summary: The customer, Poey Wong, experienced a spillage issue where drinks leaked onto food items due to poor packaging design. The customer expressed frustration over the handling of their complaint, feeling that their issue was not adequately addressed and that the chat was closed prematurely without resolution.

Good day ! I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the poor quality
straw i have experience.

*Please refer to the attach photo .*

The straw cracked after 1-2 hours and could no longer be used at all . I
don't think it's possible for everyone to finish their drinks within an
hour. I understand that ZUS chooses to use rice paper straws instead of
plastic straws because it does not cause serious harm to the environment
and other organisms but I also hope that some improvements can be made.

As a customer , we would appreciate it if your team could make the
improvement as outlined. Thanks !

KIM

454421,"Hi,

Please be informed that I did not receive my coffee this morning due to Zus
apps problem. In the apps it shows that it has been delivered but I did not
receive it.

Received a call from the driver 011 3711 5289 mentioning that the app has
an issue and they are not able to cancel it from their end or the outlet
(as he is at the outlet to pick up the order)

He then called again when I was in  a meeting asking me to cancel the order
via Zus apps and when i'm not able to do so I was scolded and cursed.

Please look into this. I want my refund and apology from your end. It has
ruined my day just because I was F* by a rider due to your apps issues.

",Payment,Double Payment Charges,Payment Gateway,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: App issue related to a top-up transaction  
Identified Problem: The customer topped up a total of RM20 but only received RM10 in their app balance.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The first top-up of RM10 showed as pending, leading the customer to make a second top-up.  
- Possible system error or miscommunication regarding the transaction status.  
Resolution Offered: The agent requested the customer's bank details to process a refund for the missing RM10, which would take up to 14 working days.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced an issue with the app where a total top-up of RM20 resulted in only RM10 being credited to their account. This was attributed to a pending status on the first transaction, which may indicate a system error or miscommunication. The agent offered a resolution by initiating a refund process, requiring the customer's bank details, and assured that the refund would be processed within 14 working days.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,PAYMENT ERROR / FAILURE,85,Payment Error / Failure,5563

",Cancellation,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect order and request for a refund  
Identified Problem: Customer mistakenly ordered from the wrong outlet and did not pick up the order.
