",Feedback / Improvement,Complaints,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to update or delete credit card details

Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear instructions on how to update credit card details  
- Miscommunication regarding the retention of previous credit card information  
Resolution Offered: Request for a screen recording to escalate the issue to the technical team  
Overall Summary: The customer, Monique Chang, reached out to update her credit card details but faced difficulties in doing so.

However, the customer was unable to delete or update her credit card, leading to frustration. The agent requested a screen recording to escalate the issue but ultimately closed the chat without a resolution.

I am at Jaya One right now and I just ordered a CEO latte from counter, when I read in the receipt that I have actually earned 9 Zus Points from the order. 

When I try to scan the qr it leads me to nowhere. I checked with your cashier they told me if purchase made from counter (not from the App) needs to provide mobile no. Clearly your cashier did not ask me prior to my order and they told me it is too bad they can't do anything about it. 

As a first time Zus App user and also a new Zus customers, I feel kinda disappointed towards your staffs here although your coffee is serve as good as my expectations. I am a seasoned home barista for years FYI.

The agent suggested the customer reach out to Foodpanda for compensation, but no direct resolution was provided by the coffee chain.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,85,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,4558

Primary Concern: Lack of a ""no sugar"" option in the ordering system  
Identified Problem: The ordering system only provides options for ""normal"" and ""less sugar,"" leading to frequent errors in fulfilling the customer's request for no sugar.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The ordering system does not include a ""no sugar"" option, which is a specific request from the customer.  
- Miscommunication or lack of clarity in the ordering process, as the customer has to write ""no sugar"" in remarks, which is often overlooked.  
Resolution Offered: The agent acknowledged the issue but did not provide a specific resolution or change to the ordering options.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over the inability to select a ""no sugar"" option when ordering, leading to repeated errors in their orders. The root cause appears to be a limitation in the ordering system that does not accommodate this specific request, compounded by potential miscommunication in the remarks section.

Overall Summary: The customer, Joanne Loh, expressed frustration over an extended waiting period for her coffee order placed at 10:03 AM. She reported that a staff member from the outlet canceled her order due to a system error and accused her of placing multiple orders, which she denied.

",Outlet,Wrong Order / Item(s),Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to an incorrect order/outlet issue.  
Identified Problem: The order was not being prepared because no rider was assigned, leading to confusion about the order status.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The system's inability to assign a rider in a timely manner.  
- Miscommunication regarding the cancellation policy once the order is in preparation.  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that the order could not be canceled as it was already being prepared and that a refund would be processed if a rider could not be found.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over an incorrect order and sought to cancel it. The main issue stemmed from the order not being prepared due to a lack of rider assignment, which was not communicated clearly.

",Delivery,Slow Delivery Service,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to change an order after it was placed  
Identified Problem: The system does not allow changes to orders once they are received by the outlet  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer mistakenly selected the wrong drink during the order process  
- Lack of clarity on the order modification policy prior to placing the order  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that changes cannot be made once the order is prepared and advised to double-check orders before placing them.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over mistakenly ordering the wrong drink and the inability to change it after the order was placed.

agent: We have different Mission and Vision between Philipine and Malaysia ZUS App.
agent: That is the reason why we suggest you to reach out to them
user: Can you provide me the one for Malaysia?
agent: Vision and Mission ZUS Coffee's vision and mission are centered around their commitment to providing specialty coffee as a necessity, not a luxury, and creating a welcoming space for coffee enthusiasts.
agent: We hope this information is helpful. Apart from this, is there anything else we could assist you with?
user: Can you differentiate the Mission and Vision?
user: This mission and vision statement you provided is just a general statement. Mission should be different from the Vision. The one you provided is a mix of mission and vision. Help me if you can differentiate the two
user: And also how did you know that the mission and vision of Zus Coffee Philippines is different from Malasia?
user: If you dont have access to the Zus Coffee Philippines Mission and Vision
user: Take a deep breath Khuzairi
user: Or stretch your body
user: Maybe the blood will flow to places it should...
agent: At the heart of ZUS Coffee, our mission is to bring speciality coffee - inherently seen as expensive - to the local community at an affordable price. We strive to understand what coffee means to you and commit ourselves to deliver greater convenience and accessibility for the community. At every touchpoint, we aim to deliver the best ZUS Coffee experience to ensure that ZUS Coffee is always a Necessity, not a Luxury.

user: What about the Vision?
agent: We do not  have any information on the Philipines Mission and Vision and that why we assume it is different.
agent: We apologise for the inconvenience and hope to serve you better in the future.¬†
agent: From the beginning, our vision was always to deliver specialty coffee as a daily necessity for ALL to enjoy. For many, specialty coffee is often seen as a luxury, something you treat yourself to on special occasions. We wanted to change this perception.

agent: Every ZUS Coffee is a cup of clean, consistent and well-handled coffee. With the best quality ingredients, high-level coffee brewing technology and innovative business model, we are evolving the concept of coffee consumption to make specialty coffee affordable for everyone, everyday.

agent: With over 39 million cups delivered to date, we only have our ZUSsies to thank for all our achievements thus far. Your amazing loyalty and support are what motivated us to keep our promise to you and ensure that ZUS Coffee is always a Necessity, not a Luxury.
agent: We hope this information is helpful. Apart from this, is there anything else we could assist you with?
user: Thanks for being honest Khuzairi, its not your fault if Zus doesn't have the specific ""Vision statement"" even in Malaysia. Maybe you can raise this to someone higher. So that way they can improve the website. Because the only thing that is obvious is the Mission of Zus. The Vision statement is missing. That's why the website is not helping. Well I think you also base your response from the website, that's why you can't provide other information. But yeah thank you, its not your fault.
agent: We appreciate your feedback and will promptly relay it to the appropriate department in order to enhance our services in the future.

437095,"user: Hi, I ordered coffee for pick up and I‚Äôm writing because I‚Äôm not satisfied with the waiting time. I usually get my drinks within 10 to 15 minutes, even when there are a lot of orders, and I totally understand that cuz there are only a few baristas to make the coffee. However, I waited more than 45 minutes to get my coffee today.My order number is 2122, yet orders 2123 and 2126 were served faster than mine. I noticed that some customers who arrived after me received their orders before I did. I asked the barista twice about my coffee, but they only responded that they were preparing it and asked how much coffee I ordered.
user: The barista also called out order 2124 to collect the coffee but it didn‚Äôt show in the system. Maybe the customer only order for 1 cup of coffee so the customer can get it asap? I know this because I‚Äôve been sitting in front of the counter for 45 minutes ;)
