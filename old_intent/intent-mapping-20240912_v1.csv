This typically results from the outlet failing to include all ordered items during packing or preparation. Issues that involve customers receiving fewer items than ordered, or specific items not being included in the delivery, should be categorized here. The issue is related to the completeness of the order as prepared by the outlet, not with the delivery execution.

,,Wrong Drink,"Select this intent when the customer reports receiving a specific incorrect drink or a drink that is missing key ingredients. This intent is focused solely on drink-related mistakes, where the issue is limited to the drink itself. It excludes cases involving customization errors like milk type, sweetness level, ice amount, temperature, or additional add-ons (such as velvet cream, boba, or drizzle).

The resolution typically involves resending the correct drink or offering compensation specific to that drink.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Wrong Food,"Select this when a customer receives an incorrect food item due to issues such as incorrect labeling, packing errors, or the customer mistakenly ordering the wrong item.

The resolution generally involves resending the correct items, refunding the customer, or recovering the missing parts of the order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Foam Issue,"Select this when customers or agents report problems related to foam or volume in their drinks. This category covers a wide range of concerns, including: coffees that are only half-filled, drinks with excessive foam resulting in less liquid quantity than expected, instances where foam thickness dissipates during delivery leading to perceived volume reduction, beverages that appear to have less volume or quantity than anticipated, and drinks that are not full upon delivery. It also encompasses situations where customers question the serving size due to receiving a cup of coffee that wasn't full, express that the drink was less than expected in terms of volume, or report receiving a drink significantly less in quantity than usual, which may taste too strong due to insufficient milk. Additionally, this classification includes cases where the drink had a thicker foam during preparation, which then dissipated during delivery, causing customer dissatisfaction. Overall, this category captures any dissatisfaction with drink size, measurement, or perceived value related to foam and volume issues, regardless of whether the problem occurred during preparation or delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
