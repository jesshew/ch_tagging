This intent applies whenever an OTP is involved, regardless of whether the customer is trying to update contact information (e.g., changing phone number or email). It also applies when customers are unable to receive the OTP while attempting to change their phone number or log in. The focus is on authentication-related problems where the OTP is not received or accepted, not covering broader payment processing or account balance issues.

    "CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER": "Select this when a customer requests to cancel or amend their order due to an issue with the order content or timing. This excludes cases where the primary reason for cancellation is missing a promo code or voucher, even if the customer mentions the order being incorrect. Examples include placing the wrong items, needing to add or remove items, making a duplicate order, or selecting the wrong delivery time. The customer may also need to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances like an accident or emergency. In some cases, location restrictions (such as airport gates) prevent them from picking up the order. The focus of this intent is on correcting or canceling the order itself, rather than simply changing the method of pickup or delivery or addressing operational disruptions at the outlet. This intent should not be used if the cancellation is specifically due to an operational issue at the outlet, such as equipment failure, power outages or system failures.",

This includes scenarios where an order was not ready for pickup within 15 minutes, has been delayed beyond 45 minutes, or where the rider has not moved for over 30 minutes. The primary issue is customer frustration over the length of the wait time, whether due to high order volume, outlet inefficiencies, or general delays in preparation or delivery. Technical issues may be a factor, but the main reason for cancellation is time-related, not necessarily tied to specific operational problems like system malfunctions, water supply issues or power-related problem at the outlet. Exclude scenarios where a machine breakdown or other operational issue causes the delay",
    "CANCELLATION - NO RIDER": "Select this intent when customers request to cancel their order specifically due to the unavailability of a rider for delivery. This applies to scenarios where the customer waits more than 30 minutes without a rider being assigned, or where the system automatically cancels the order because of difficulties in assigning a rider. The primary concern is the absence of a rider, which prevents the order from being delivered, leading to automatic cancellation and refund processing. The focus here is on the rider assignment issue rather than general waiting time or other operational delays.",
    "CANCELLATION - WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS": "Select this when customers request to cancel their order due to selecting the wrong outlet or entering the wrong address. This includes scenarios where the customer mistakenly selected an outlet in a different city or inserted the incorrect address or pinned the wrong location. The cancellation is driven by a customer error in choosing the outlet or address, rather than an operational issue at the outlet itself. Exclude cases whereby agent gives customer a voucher as compensation, that should be \"Wrong Outlet / Address - Voucher Code\". This intent is specific to customer errors in choosing the outlet or address and excludes cancellations caused by operational issues, such as blackouts or power outages at the outlet.",
    "CHANGE / UPDATE INFO": "Select this when customers mention that they want to change their phone number or email on their account. This includes scenarios where the customer requests to update their contact information such as a phone number or email, even if OTP verification is involved.

    "CUSTOMER UNREACHABLE / UNAVAILABLE": "Select this when the customer did not receive their order because the rider was unable to contact them, leading to the order being returned to the outlet or store. This typically occurs when the rider attempts to call or message the customer but receives no response, resulting in a failed delivery attempt. The defining feature of this category is that the order was not marked as delivered but was instead returned to the store, indicating that the delivery could not be completed due to the customer being unreachable. This includes cases where the rider attempted delivery but was unable to locate the customer due to incomplete or unclear instructions. This category excludes cases where the rider marked the order as delivered or claimed it was completed.",
    "DELIVERY INFO / STATUS": "Select this intent when customers inquire about the status of their order, particularly if they are simply asking for updates or clarifications on the order\u2019s preparation or delivery progress.

This includes cases where the rider delivered to the wrong recipient (wrong person or address), failed to follow delivery instructions (such as not calling the customer on arrival or leaving it at the wrong location), or picked up the order but did not deliver it.  The key distinction is that the order is marked as delivered, despite the customer never receiving it. This category excludes instances where the order was returned to the store due to the customer being unreachable,which should be categorized under \"Customer Unreachable / Unavailable.\" The issue here lies primarily with the delivery execution, not with the restaurant\u2019s system.",

It also encompasses situations where customers question the serving size due to receiving a cup of coffee that wasn't full, express that the drink was less than expected in terms of volume, or report receiving a drink significantly less in quantity than usual, which may taste too strong due to insufficient milk.

It is specific to mistakes related to the temperature of a drink, where the rest of the order is correct but the drink's temperature does not match what was requested. The issue is isolated to the temperature of the drink, not involving multiple items or affecting the entire order. The resolution typically involves resending the correctly prepared drink or offering an adjustment, focusing solely on correcting the drink\u2019s temperature error.",

The key factor is a technical system failure at the restaurant that affects the processing or preparation of the order. System outages or syncing problems that prevent orders from being fulfilled, leading to delays, cancellations, or refund requests, fall under this category. Importantly, this excludes situations where the delay or cancellation is solely due to waiting times not related to system errors.",
    "MACHINES - BROKE DOWN": "Select this intent when customers are informed that their drink cannot be prepared or significantly delayed due to coffee machines undergoing maintenance or breaking down. Use this intent when machine malfunctions directly cause delays or cancellations. This includes cases where the customer requests a cancellation because the outlet is unable to fulfill the order due to equipment issues.

This category specifically addresses issues with unfulfilled customization requests, not broader complaints about the drink's overall quality.",
    "MISSED OUT - ORDER": "Select this intent when a customer reports that one or more items were missing from their order upon receipt. This typically results from the outlet failing to include all ordered items during packing or preparation. Issues that involve customers receiving fewer items than ordered, or specific items not being included in the delivery, should be categorized here. The issue is related to the completeness of the order as prepared by the outlet, not with the delivery execution.  Do not use this intent for minor items like stickers, straws, or add-ons, which should be categorized under \"Missed Out - Remarks.\" The focus is on the main items missing, not delivery errors or minor omissions.",

This includes cases where they forgot to enter a voucher or discount code, apply a discount voucher, or use a \"buy one, get one free\" code.

This includes situations where stock issues prevent the fulfillment of the order, such as a specific item not being available at the time of ordering or becoming unavailable during processing.

The customer typically realizes the error after placing the order and contacts support to request a change in how they will receive their order. The key issue is the incorrect selection of pickup or delivery during the ordering process, and the customer\u2019s goal is to modify the fulfillment method, not to change or cancel the order itself.
