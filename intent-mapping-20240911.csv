Level 1,Level 1 Description,Level 2 (MH),Level 2 Description
Order Status & Delivery,"Select this intent when customers inquire about the status or progress of their order, whether it’s related to pickup or delivery, including both inquiries made within 15 minutes of placing the order and those made after 15 minutes. This includes situations where customers ask for updates on rider allocation, report delays in delivery time, or face issues with tracking their order. Additionally, select this intent when customers report problems such as slow rider assignment, delivery delays, wrong addresses or recipients, failed deliveries, or if they are outside the delivery range and unable to place an order. Exclude cases related to barista issues, service quality, or when customers are unreachable, as these have separate classifications.",Pickup Info / Status,Select this when customers inquire about the status of their order. This includes both situations where the inquiry is made within 15 minutes of placing the order and when it is made after 15 minutes.
,,Delivery Info / Status,"Select this intent when customers inquire about the status of their order, particularly if they are simply asking for updates or clarifications on the order’s preparation or delivery progress. Use this intent for situations where the customer is not reporting any barista-related issues or service quality problems but is instead focused on the status of the delivery or order completion. This includes both situations where the inquiry is made within 15 minutes of placing the order and when it is made after 15 minutes."
,,Slow Rider Allocation,"Select this when customers report that a rider was not scheduled or assigned to the order in a timely manner, leading to delays in the order delivery. This includes situations where there is a prolonged period without a rider being allocated to the order, causing a delay in pickup or delivery. The focus here is on the timing and scheduling of rider assignments rather than the rider’s behavior or conduct."
,,Slow Delivery Service,"Select this when customers report that their orders were not delivered within the expected 45-minute timeframe. This intent is used specifically for cases where the primary issue is the speed of delivery, rather than technical system problems. Descriptions for this intent will focus on delays caused by external factors, such as rider speed or traffic, and are not related to system glitches or order synchronization issues. The key distinguishing factor is that the delay is purely a logistical issue without mention of any technical or system-related problems."
,,Failed Delivery,"Select this when the customer did not receive their order, but the rider marked or claimed it was delivered. This includes cases where the rider delivered to the wrong recipient (wrong person or address), failed to follow delivery instructions (such as not calling the customer on arrival or leaving it at the wrong location), or picked up the order but did not deliver it.  The key distinction is that the order is marked as delivered, despite the customer never receiving it. This category excludes instances where the order was returned to the store due to the customer being unreachable,which should be categorized under ""Customer Unreachable / Unavailable."" The issue here lies primarily with the delivery execution, not with the restaurant’s system."
,,Customer Unreachable / Unavailable,"Select this when the customer did not receive their order because the rider was unable to contact them, leading to the order being returned to the outlet or store. This typically occurs when the rider attempts to call or message the customer but receives no response, resulting in a failed delivery attempt. The defining feature of this category is that the order was not marked as delivered but was instead returned to the store, indicating that the delivery could not be completed due to the customer being unreachable. This includes cases where the rider attempted delivery but was unable to locate the customer due to incomplete or unclear instructions. This category excludes cases where the rider marked the order as delivered or claimed it was completed."
,,Tracking Error,Select this when customers report that they are unable to view the rider tracking link or details in the ZUS app. This includes issues where the tracking feature does not work from the customer's end or the delivery information is missing.
,,Delivery Range,"Select this when customers are unable to place an order because their location is outside the delivery range or the app incorrectly handles their address. This includes situations where the customer's address is within the allowable range but the app still prevents ordering, issues with pinning the correct location, or incorrect location pinning by the app."
,,Wrong Address / Recipient,"Select this when the customer received an order, but it was the wrong one, or the delivery was made to the wrong person or address. This includes cases where the customer received someone else’s order or the order was delivered to the wrong location due to a delivery error. The defining feature here is that the customer received an incorrect order, and the issue is related to misdelivery, not non-receipt. If the customer did not receive any order at all, the issue should be categorized as ""Failed Delivery."""
Order Accuracy Issues,"Select this intent when there are any issues related to order inaccuracies or fulfillment problems involving drinks, food, or delivery. This includes receiving incorrect drinks or food items due to preparation, labeling, or packing mistakes, such as wrong or missing drinks or food, or situations where entire orders are incorrect or incomplete. It also covers missing key ingredients in drinks, missing main food items, or overlooked customization requests like ice levels, sweetness, milk type, or add-ons (e.g., velvet cream, boba). Additionally, use this intent when non-drink or drink-related special instructions, such as requests for napkins, straws, or temperature preferences (e.g., hot vs. iced drinks), are not followed. It applies to out-of-stock situations resulting in cancellations or refunds, inappropriate rider behavior (e.g., rudeness or failure to deliver properly), mistakes in fulfillment method (pickup vs. delivery), receiving extra items by mistake, or the absence of essential accessories like straws or cutlery. The resolution typically involves refunds, redelivery, or adjustments to the order, with out-of-stock issues taking priority over other concerns.",Wrong Drink,"Select this intent when the customer reports receiving a specific incorrect drink or a drink that is missing key ingredients. This intent is focused solely on drink-related mistakes, where the issue is limited to the drink itself. It excludes cases involving customization errors like milk type, sweetness level, ice amount, temperature, or additional add-ons (such as velvet cream, boba, or drizzle). The customer’s complaint should be about receiving the wrong drink entirely or a drink that is missing its key components. The resolution typically involves resending the correct drink or offering compensation specific to that drink."
,,Wrong Food,"Select this when a customer receives an incorrect food item due to issues such as incorrect labeling, packing errors, or the customer mistakenly ordering the wrong item. This category is focused specifically on errors involving a single food item within the order, such as receiving a puff instead of lasagna or a chocolate donut instead of a chocolate roll. The resolution typically involves addressing the error related to that particular food item, either by replacing it or issuing a refund."
,,Wrong Order / Item(s),"Select this intent when the issue involves the entire order or multiple items, including drinks and/or food, being incorrect or incomplete. This applies to broader fulfillment errors, such as receiving someone else’s order, missing items, or multiple incorrect items, affecting more than just a single drink. The problem may include a mix-up with both food and drinks or a general issue with how the entire order was handled. This intent should be used when the scope of the mistake goes beyond just one drink and affects multiple aspects of the order. The resolution generally involves resending the correct items, refunding the customer, or recovering the missing parts of the order."
,,Missed Out - Order,"Select this intent when a customer reports that one or more items were missing from their order upon receipt. This typically results from the outlet failing to include all ordered items during packing or preparation. Issues that involve customers receiving fewer items than ordered, or specific items not being included in the delivery, should be categorized here. The issue is related to the completeness of the order as prepared by the outlet, not with the delivery execution.  Do not use this intent for minor items like stickers, straws, or add-ons, which should be categorized under ""Missed Out - Remarks."" The focus is on the main items missing, not delivery errors or minor omissions."
,,OOS,"Select this intent when the primary issue is that an item or ingredient is explicitly mentioned as being out of stock, sold out, or unavailable at the outlet or location, whether this occurs before or after a purchase is made. This includes situations where stock issues prevent the fulfillment of the order, such as a specific item not being available at the time of ordering or becoming unavailable during processing. The key distinguishing factor is the explicit mention of stock unavailability, which takes precedence over other concerns and directly impacts the order fulfillment process, typically resulting in cancellation and refund."
,,Rider Behavior,"Select this when the issue involves inappropriate or unprofessional conduct by the delivery rider that affects the service experience. This includes situations where the rider exhibits rude behavior, fails to communicate effectively (such as not answering calls or hanging up), requests additional payment unexpectedly, or encounters logistical issues like a motorbike breakdown. Additionally, it covers cases where the rider updates the delivery status to ""delivered"" before actually completing the delivery or shows other forms of unresponsiveness or negligence during the delivery process."
,,Received Extra Item(s),"Select this when customers report receiving additional items in their order that were not intended for them, either due to barista or rider mistakes."
,,No - Straw Given / Cutleries,Select this when customers complain about not receiving necessary items like straws or cutleries with their order.
,,Hot / Iced Mistakes,"Select this when customers receive a hot drink instead of an iced one, or vice versa, due to incorrect preparation. It is specific to mistakes related to the temperature of a drink, where the rest of the order is correct but the drink's temperature does not match what was requested. The issue is isolated to the temperature of the drink, not involving multiple items or affecting the entire order. The resolution typically involves resending the correctly prepared drink or offering an adjustment, focusing solely on correcting the drink’s temperature error."
,,Pickup / Delivery Mistakes,"Select this when a customer mistakenly selects the wrong fulfillment option, choosing pickup instead of delivery, or vice versa. The customer typically realizes the error after placing the order and contacts support to request a change in how they will receive their order. The key issue is the incorrect selection of pickup or delivery during the ordering process, and the customer’s goal is to modify the fulfillment method, not to change or cancel the order itself. In these cases, the order contents are usually correct, and the request is centered on adjusting how the order is collected or delivered."
,,Missed Out - Remarks,"Select this when a customer reports that non-drink-related order remarks or special instructions were not followed, such as requests for additional napkins, paper bags, or a straw for their coffee (even if they forgot to include it when placing the order). This excludes any issues related to drink customizations, such as ice, sugar, or add-ons, which should be categorized under ""Missed Out - Drinks Remarks."" Do not use this intent for larger issues like wrong or missing drinks or food items. Also exclude issues related to missed add-ons (e.g., velvet cream, coffee jelly, boba), temperature preferences (e.g., warmer, less ice), wrong milk type, or sweetness level."
,,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,"Select this when a customer reports that any drink-related remarks or special instructions were not followed, including cases where customization requests were overlooked. This covers missed add-ons (e.g., velvet cream, coffee jelly, boba, pearls, drizzle), incorrect temperature preferences (e.g., warmer, less hot, less ice, hotter), wrong milk type (e.g., dairy, almond, oat, soy), incorrect ice levels (e.g., no ice, less ice), or incorrect sweetness level (e.g., no sugar, less sweet, regular sweetness). This category specifically addresses issues with unfulfilled customization requests, not broader complaints about the drink's overall quality."

"
,,Complaints,"Select this intent when customers raise complaints that are not tied to specific order-related issues or lack a clear resolution, such as when an agent can only apologize or thank the customer without resolving the issue. It includes complaints about incorrect order preparation, repeated occurrences of the same problem, confusion or delays in the ordering or preparation process, and dissatisfaction with missing app features or services. This intent also applies to complaints about orders being canceled without notification, issues related to outlet facilities, or concerns about the terms and conditions of promotions, vouchers, or gift cards. Additionally, it covers instances where outlets turn away walk-in customers or customers complain about company-related information. This excludes complaints regarding hygiene or quality issues."

For drinks, this includes issues such as taste discrepancies (e.g., too strong, bland, incorrect flavor), freshness concerns, contamination (e.g., coffee residues, foreign objects), and expired ingredients. It also applies to complaints about noticeable differences in taste between outlets and missed customizations that impact the perceived quality, though not when the sole issue is the missing customization itself. For cakes, this intent covers problems with taste (e.g., sour or strange flavors), staleness, and contamination. For pastries, it includes complaints about cold pastries, lack of filling, or the presence of foreign objects.

This category is specifically for delivery-related spillage issues, where the contents leaked or spilled during the delivery process. It covers scenarios such as bags breaking during transit, containers tipping over, or drinks leaking due to movement or mishandling. The packaging may have appeared intact, but the focus is on the spill that occurred specifically due to delivery. This classification also includes cases where the cup or container arrived broken, resulting in spillage. The key factor for this category is that the spill happened during delivery, regardless of the initial packaging condition."
,,Packaging,"Select this when customer complaints relate to the process, quality, and adequacy of packaging, regardless of whether a spill occurred. This category focuses on packaging effectiveness and safety, not the occurrence of a spill itself. It includes issues such as improper packaging or seals, lids not tightly closed, drinks or packaging not taped properly, damaged packaging leading to potential spills, bottle caps breaking, drinks served in the wrong-sized cups, and requests for cup sleeves or other protective materials.

,,Foam Issue,"Select this when customers or agents report problems related to foam or volume in their drinks. This category covers a wide range of concerns, including: coffees that are only half-filled, drinks with excessive foam resulting in less liquid quantity than expected, instances where foam thickness dissipates during delivery leading to perceived volume reduction, beverages that appear to have less volume or quantity than anticipated, and drinks that are not full upon delivery. It also encompasses situations where customers question the serving size due to receiving a cup of coffee that wasn't full, express that the drink was less than expected in terms of volume, or report receiving a drink significantly less in quantity than usual, which may taste too strong due to insufficient milk. Additionally, this classification includes cases where the drink had a thicker foam during preparation, which then dissipated during delivery, causing customer dissatisfaction. Overall, this category captures any dissatisfaction with drink size, measurement, or perceived value related to foam and volume issues, regardless of whether the problem occurred during preparation or delivery."

The primary focus is on confirming and resolving instances of actual double charges."
,,Payment Status,"Select this intent when customers inquire about the current status of a payment they made. It focuses on situations where there are no technical failures, and the customer simply seeks confirmation about whether the payment was completed or is still pending.

This applies to scenarios where the customer waits more than 30 minutes without a rider being assigned, or where the system automatically cancels the order because of difficulties in assigning a rider.

,,Cancellation - Wrong Outlet / Address,"Select this when customers request to cancel their order due to selecting the wrong outlet or entering the wrong address. This includes scenarios where the customer mistakenly selected an outlet in a different city or inserted the incorrect address or pinned the wrong location.

Examples include placing the wrong items, needing to add or remove items, making a duplicate order, or selecting the wrong delivery time. The customer may also need to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances like an accident or emergency. In some cases, location restrictions (such as airport gates) prevent them from picking up the order. The focus of this intent is on correcting or canceling the order itself, rather than simply changing the method of pickup or delivery or addressing operational disruptions at the outlet. This intent should not be used if the cancellation is specifically due to an operational issue at the outlet, such as equipment failure, power outages or system failures."
,,Cancellation - Long Waiting Time,"Select this intent when customers request to cancel their order due to extended waiting periods. This includes scenarios where an order was not ready for pickup within 15 minutes, has been delayed beyond 45 minutes, or where the rider has not moved for over 30 minutes. The primary issue is customer frustration over the length of the wait time, whether due to high order volume, outlet inefficiencies, or general delays in preparation or delivery. Technical issues may be a factor, but the main reason for cancellation is time-related, not necessarily tied to specific operational problems like system malfunctions, water supply issues or power-related problem at the outlet. Exclude scenarios where a machine breakdown or other operational issue causes the delay"

In these cases, the order contents are usually correct, and the request is centered on adjusting how the order is collected or delivered."
,,KDS & Xilnex Issue,"Select this intent when customers or riders report issues related to the Kitchen Display System (KDS) or the Point of Sales (Xilnex) system, which may cause problems such as orders being incorrectly marked as ""delivered"" instead of ""pickup,"" delays due to orders stuck in ""preparing,"" or outlets not receiving orders. The key factor is a technical system failure at the restaurant that affects the processing or preparation of the order. System outages or syncing problems that prevent orders from being fulfilled, leading to delays, cancellations, or refund requests, fall under this category. Importantly, this excludes situations where the delay or cancellation is solely due to waiting times not related to system errors."
,,Missed Out - Promo Code,"Select this intent when customers want to cancel an order primarily because they missed applying a promo code or voucher. Even if the order contains mistakes, the focus must be on the missed promotional opportunity, including cases where the system error removed a voucher, or the voucher was invalid. This includes issues with forgotten promo codes, discount vouchers, or ""buy one, get one free"" offers.

Use this intent when machine malfunctions directly cause delays or cancellations. This includes cases where the customer requests a cancellation because the outlet is unable to fulfill the order due to equipment issues. If a machine breakdown is the core issue leading to extended waiting times or order cancellations, this intent should apply. The focus is on operational failures, not on customer frustration purely over delays unrelated to machine issues."

,,Outlet - Air Conditioner Issue,"Select this when customers report issues with the air conditioning/AC at an outlet, causing discomfort or inconvenience during their visit."
