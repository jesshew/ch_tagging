","Customer sentiment: Irritated  
Primary Issue: The customer received a drink that was supposed to have ""no sugar, no ice,"" but it was served with full ice. When the customer requested a redo, the staff member only removed a few ice cubes and did not apologize, leading to dissatisfaction with the staff's attitude.  
Cause of issue: The staff failed to follow the customer's order instructions and did not handle the situation appropriately when the customer raised the issue.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving a drink with full ice despite specifying ""no ice"" in their order. The staff's inadequate response and lack of apology exacerbated the situation, leading the customer to request compensation. The agent acknowledged the issue, apologized, and offered a 20% discount voucher as compensation while assuring that the matter would be escalated for further action. The customer hopes for improvements in staff attitude, indicating this is not the first negative experience.",Missed Out - Remarks,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,ORDER ACCURACY ISSUES,6329
