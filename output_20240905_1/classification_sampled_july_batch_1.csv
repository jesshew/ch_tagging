I'm writing in regards to your outlet Zus Kulim, Kedah.

I placed 2 ordered separately. Topped up RM3 for Oat base. However, your staff ZyFaa said Oatside out of stock in replacement for Oatly.  I requested to made one for Oatly base, the other to Almond base. That's simple.
Totally disappointed with your staff insisting both had to be same choice of base!
I beg your pardon, could you explain on her behalf what's wrong with the staff understanding of customer's request.

Very dissatisfied with the service & ordered. Making payment of what a customer's choice yet we couldn't get what we wanted. We wish to have an explanation if it means to compensation for a drink of Almond base.

Hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
Doris
