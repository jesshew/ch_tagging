user: You too 😊",Delivery,Slow Delivery Service,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery and quality of received drinks  
Identified Problem: Delay in the delivery process leading to drinks not being fresh upon arrival  
Contributing Factors:  
- The delivery driver was initially at the branch but later appeared to be far away, causing confusion and delay.  
- The drinks were prepared but not collected in a timely manner, leading to concerns about freshness.  
Resolution Offered: The drinks were remade to ensure freshness, and a refund was issued to the customer's ZUS Balance.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced a significant delay in receiving their coffee order, which took over an hour despite being only 5 minutes away from the outlet. Upon arrival, the drinks were not fresh, with melted ice and undissolved ingredients. The agent acknowledged the issue, arranged for the drinks to be remade, and issued a refund. The root cause of the issue appears to be a delay in the delivery process, compounded by a lack of communication regarding the driver's location. The customer expressed frustration but appreciated the resolution and refund.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,CANCELLATION - LONG WAITING TIME,75,Cancellation - Long Waiting Time,5841

Primary Concern: Quality of the ordered drinks  
Identified Problem: The drinks did not meet the customer's expectations, leading to a request for compensation.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer received only one drink instead of the two ordered.  
- There was a delay in the response time from the customer service team, which may have contributed to the customer's frustration.  
Resolution Offered: The agent offered to send a replacement for the drinks, specifically one fresh Iced Buttercrème Spanish Latté, and the customer requested two drinks instead. A new order was created for tracking.

Primary Concern: Customer wants to change their order from delivery to self-pickup.  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the order type (self-pickup vs. delivery) and the inability to cancel the order once assigned to a rider.

",Outlet,Wrong Drink,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Received the wrong drink (Latte instead of Spanish Latte)  
Identified Problem: Order preparation error at the outlet  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the order details  
- Lack of drink stamp due to ordering through Tumblr, complicating verification  
Resolution Offered: Replacement drink to be picked up at the outlet  
Overall Summary: The customer, Min Ghazali, reported receiving the wrong drink (Latte instead of the ordered Spanish Latte) and expressed frustration over the mix-up. The agent confirmed the error and offered to reorder the correct drink for pickup. The root cause of the issue appears to be an order preparation error at the outlet, compounded by the customer's inability to provide a drink stamp for verification due to the ordering method. The customer was informed they could pick up the replacement drink later the same day.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,WRONG DRINK,85,Wrong Drink,6108

Primary Concern: Quality of drinks received  
Identified Problem: Possible use of non-fresh milk in drinks  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of quality control at the specific branch  
- Potential systemic issues with product freshness or preparation  
Resolution Offered: Refund for the affected drinks to the customer's ZUS Balance  
Overall Summary: The customer, Mikhail Ashmann, raised a concern regarding the quality of multiple drinks received in an order, specifically mentioning that they tasted off, possibly due to non-fresh milk. The customer expressed disappointment, noting their history of minimal complaints. The agent offered a refund for the affected drinks and acknowledged the feedback for quality control improvements. The customer accepted the refund but indicated they would consider ordering from a different branch in the future. The root cause appears to be a lack of quality control at the branch level, leading to product freshness issues.",PRODUCT QUALITY / HYGIENE ISSUE,85,QUALITY COMPLAINT - DRINK,85,Quality Complaint - Drink,5356

",Cancellation,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Appreciative  
Primary Concern: Incorrect order quantity for cappuccinos  
Identified Problem: Customer mistakenly ordered three cappuccinos instead of one due to a typing error.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the order status; the customer believed the order was not prepared.  
- Lack of clarity in the ordering process that led to the input error.  
Resolution Offered: Refund of the amount for the three cappuccinos to the customer's ZUS Balance as a one-time exception.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially raised a concern about an incorrect order, specifically wanting to cancel three cappuccinos due to a typing error. After some back and forth regarding the order status, the agent confirmed that the order was being prepared but offered a refund for the incorrectly ordered items as a one-time exception. The customer expressed gratitude for the assistance and acknowledged the need to be more careful in the future. The root cause of the issue was the customer's input error during the ordering process, compounded by initial miscommunication about the order's preparation status.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,85,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,5093

agent: Upon review, it appears that the payment was not processed through our payment portal.
user: Then now ya
user: *how
user: 
agent: We recommend that you contact the bank or Shoppee customer service directly to inquire about the status of the payment.
agent: We have concerns about the possibility of the payment floating.
user: So i can’t have my order? I can’t even reorder because of the fact that I have “used” the voucher
agent: We encourage you to consider using an alternative payment method when reordering.
agent: We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the payment error.
user: alternative payment method… then what’s the point of having the promo though
user: like I have my reason on why I opt to use the spay since I got cheaper price
agent: We understand your concern above, but we are concerned that the payment may encounter errors once again. Therefore, we kindly request that you consider using an alternative payment method.
user: alternative payment method =/ spay. I opt to use spay because I purchase the drink with much cheaper price?? If I need to use the other payment method then??? i’m buying with a normal price lah?
user: can you drop that same template of saying “using an alternative payment method” because that’s obviously not a solution
agent: As previously stated, we have not yet received the payment in our payment portal. Therefore, we kindly request that you contact Shopee customer service directly to inquire about any potential delays in the payment process from their end.
agent: Meanwhile we will escalate this matter to our technical team to verify if the payment has been captured for further confirmation. Thank you for your patience.
agent: Please allow us some time to check and get back to you once we have received a response from the team. Thank you for your understanding.
agent: Hope that clarifies. Apart from this anything else we could assist you with?
user: Let me know if my order counts or not once you speak to your technical team. I will also ask the Shopee if they deduct it or not. Because if not then I can use the promotion again since the “error” one doesn’t count.
agent: Kindly note that if the order is cancelled, the voucher will be refunded to your account. We recommend verifying this information with Shoppee for further clarification.

Primary Concern: Payment was successful, but the order status remained ""Payment Pending"" and was subsequently canceled.  
Identified Problem: A system error or miscommunication regarding the payment status led to the order being marked as pending and eventually canceled.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer reported that the payment was successful on their end, but the system did not reflect this.  
- The system's automatic cancellation policy for orders that remain in ""Payment Pending"" status for too long.  
Resolution Offered: The agent requested proof of payment and acknowledged the inconvenience caused, but no immediate resolution was provided during the chat.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a payment that was successful but not recognized by the system, leading to the cancellation of their order. The root cause appears to be a system error or miscommunication regarding the payment status, compounded by the automatic cancellation policy for pending payments. The interaction ended without a satisfactory resolution for the customer.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,90,PAYMENT ERROR / FAILURE,85,Payment Error / Failure,6279

Primary Concern: Customer's order was canceled after payment was made, and they were unsure about the refund process.  
Identified Problem: The order was canceled by the rider due to a miscommunication regarding the delivery instructions.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The rider did not see the note left by the customer for delivery at the hotel lobby.  
- There was a lack of available riders to fulfill the new order after the initial cancellation.  
Resolution Offered: The agent created a new order for the customer and offered a refund option, but the customer opted to pick up the order instead.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced an issue where their order was canceled after payment due to a miscommunication with the delivery rider. Despite the frustration, the agent worked to resolve the issue by creating a new order and confirming the customer's preference to pick up the order at the outlet. The root cause of the issue stemmed from the rider's failure to notice the delivery instructions, compounded by a lack of available riders for subsequent orders.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,RIDER BEHAVIOR,85,Rider Behavior,4811

Primary Concern: Double payment charges on the customer's account  
Identified Problem: The customer believes they were charged twice for a single transaction, but the agent's system only shows one approved transaction.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer’s bank may have placed a hold on the transaction, leading to confusion about double charges.  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the transaction date and details between the customer and the agent.  
Resolution Offered: The agent advised the customer to check with their bank regarding the double charge, as the payment system only recorded one transaction.  
Overall Summary: The customer contacted ZUS Coffee regarding a perceived double charge on their account for an order made on July 14, 2024. The agent confirmed that only one transaction was recorded in their system. The customer was advised to check with their bank, as it is possible that the bank placed a hold on the charge, which could explain the confusion. The root cause of the issue appears to be a misunderstanding related to the bank's processing of the transaction rather than an error on ZUS Coffee's part.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,85,Double Payment Charges,5656

",Payment,Double Payment Charges,Payment Gateway,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: User experienced issues with app transactions and a delayed refund.  
Identified Problem: The app failed to process the initial top-up transaction, leading to a double charge.  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error in the app causing transaction failures.  
- Miscommunication regarding the refund process and timeline.  
Resolution Offered: Refund to the user's bank account, with a processing time of up to 14 working days.  
Overall Summary: The customer faced issues with the ZUS Coffee app where a top-up of RM20 was unsuccessful, yet the amount was deducted from their bank account. After attempting a second top-up, which was successful, the customer sought clarification on the refund for the first transaction. The agent confirmed the refund would be processed to the bank account provided, but the customer expressed frustration over the app's functionality and the refund timeline. The root cause of the issue appears to be a system error within the app that led to transaction failures.",APP FUNCTIONALITY,85,APP - BUFFERING / LAG,85,App - Buffering / Lag,5306

Primary Concern: Delivery proof and communication issues with the delivery rider  
Identified Problem: Lack of proper delivery proof and communication from the delivery rider  
Contributing Factors:  
- The rider did not capture a photo of the delivery as proof.  
- The customer was unable to answer the rider's call due to driving, leading to miscommunication.

The agent acknowledged the issue, offered to resend the order, and provided a discount voucher as compensation. The interaction ended positively, with the customer expressing appreciation for the service received.

Primary Concern: Received a drink with no coffee taste, only milk.  
Identified Problem: Incorrect preparation of the Hot Caramel Macchiato, leading to a poor quality drink.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication or error in the drink preparation process.  
- Customer's expectation of receiving the full price of the drink was not met due to a discount applied.  
Resolution Offered: Refund of RM9.52 issued to the customer, which was the discounted price of the drink.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Alya Kahar, expressed frustration over receiving a Hot Caramel Macchiato that tasted only of milk, lacking coffee flavor. The agent acknowledged the issue, apologized, and offered a refund instead of a replacement drink due to a discount applied to the order. The customer accepted the refund but was initially confused about the amount.
