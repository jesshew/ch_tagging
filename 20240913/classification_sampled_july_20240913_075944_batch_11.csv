user: Sy mmg zuss lover . Selalu beli . Bila dpt order mcm ni tadi. Trus kecewa.
agent: Thank you for your patience. According to our inquiry with the outlet, the velvet creme was already added to the Iced Spanish Latte. However, due to a delay in collecting the drink, the velvet creme dissolved inside.

How about this?

After clarification, the agent informed the customer that previous credit card information is not retained and suggested adding new details. However, the customer was unable to delete or update her credit card, leading to frustration. The agent requested a screen recording to escalate the issue but ultimately closed the chat without a resolution.

I am at Jaya One right now and I just ordered a CEO latte from counter, when I read in the receipt that I have actually earned 9 Zus Points from the order. 

When I try to scan the qr it leads me to nowhere. I checked with your cashier they told me if purchase made from counter (not from the App) needs to provide mobile no. Clearly your cashier did not ask me prior to my order and they told me it is too bad they can't do anything about it. 

As a first time Zus App user and also a new Zus customers, I feel kinda disappointed towards your staffs here although your coffee is serve as good as my expectations. I am a seasoned home barista for years FYI. 

Just sharing an experience at Zus Jaya One.

",Feedback / Improvement,App - OTP,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Unable to receive verification code due to an invalid phone number issue  
Identified Problem: The phone number provided by the customer is not recognized as registered in the ZUS Coffee system.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer is using a phone number format that may not align with the system's requirements.  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the correct format for phone numbers registered with ZUS Coffee.  
Resolution Offered: The agent suggested restarting the phone and checking the telco provider, but no direct resolution was provided for the verification code issue.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving a verification code due to their phone number being flagged as invalid. Despite multiple attempts to provide their number in different formats, the issue persisted. The root cause appears to be a mismatch between the customer's phone number format and the ZUS Coffee registration system, compounded by a lack of clear guidance on the correct format.

Contributing Factors:  
- The ordering system does not include a ""no sugar"" option, which is a specific request from the customer.  
- Miscommunication or lack of clarity in the ordering process, as the customer has to write ""no sugar"" in remarks, which is often overlooked.

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over the inability to select a ""no sugar"" option when ordering, leading to repeated errors in their orders.

Dear Bawani,

Thank you so so much for your prompt actions and additional information! I
truly appreciate it!!

After checking the branch at Boulevard, I can finally place the order and
enjoy the cakes with my family, and having a complimentary handcrafted
drink voucher is just the right cherry on the cake!!

Kudos to you! Please keep up the good work ?

Best regards,
Dorothy



Hi Dorothy,  Greetings from ZUS Coffee.     Thank you for your reply. We would like to extend our apologies for the unavailability of the cake at our outlets in Sarawak and Sabah. This is due to delays in shipments, resulting in limited stock availability. Thank you for your understanding.      ​We apologize for any inconvenience and have added a complimentary voucher to your account for you to enjoy a handcrafted drink of your choice.     ​Additionally, we have received confirmation from the Time Square Megamall Bintulu outlet and Boulevard Shopping Mall Bintulu outlet that the cake stock was received yesterday and is available today at the outlet.      Apologies for the inconvenience cause once again.  Should you need further assistance, please do not hesitate to let us know. Thank you and have a nice day! ?  Best Regards,       Bawani Customer Happiness Specialist     E. support@zuscoffee.com  W. www.zuscoffee.com
Hi Bawani,

Thanks so much for your reply.

I managed to receive the vouchers entitled for Zus Elite in my account a
few days ago. Thanks for explaining the cause of the delay.

However, it is very unfortunate and unfair that I cannot use the vouchers
here in Bintulu, Sarawak because the 3 branches here DO NOT have cakes and
hot meals. Same goes to the branch in Miri even if I travel there. Hence, I
believe I won't be the only Zussie who faces this issue in Sarawak, hoping
to celebrate birthday with Zus yet to much disappointment.

Kindly address this so that Sarawakians can have the same privilege like
the Zussies in West Malaysia. If the birthday vouchers are not applicable
for Sarawakian Zussies, I would highly recommend that you consider
other alternatives so that we don't feel forgotten, abandoned and
ostracised as Satu Malaysia.

I apologize if my words sound harsh, but I sincerely hope that your company
can take care of the hearts of the Sarawak Zussies.

Note: I truly love your title as Customer Happiness Specialist.

Best regards,
Dorothy

Primary Concern: Lack of birthday and Zus Elite vouchers for the customer in Sarawak

- Limited stock availability of cakes and hot meals in Sarawak branches  
- Perceived inequity in service and offerings between Sarawak and West Malaysia

Overall Summary: The interaction began with the customer expressing disappointment over not receiving promised birthday and Zus Elite vouchers. The agent acknowledged the issue, attributing it to a system error and limited product availability in Sarawak. The customer highlighted feelings of unfairness and exclusion due to the lack of offerings in their region. The agent proposed a resolution by escalating the matter and ensuring the vouchers would be added to the customer's account shortly.

",Outlet,Performance - Barista Behaviour / Service,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order pickup and poor service from staff  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding order readiness and inadequate service from barista  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was marked as ready, but the customer experienced a significant wait time (20 minutes) for whipped cream.  
- The barista's rude behavior and dismissal of the customer's complaint exacerbated the situation.  

Resolution Offered: A 20% discount voucher for the next order as an apology.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a delayed order that was marked as ready for pickup, leading to a 20-minute wait for whipped cream. Additionally, the customer faced rude treatment from the barista, who ignored their complaint. The agent acknowledged the issue, apologized, and offered a discount voucher as compensation. The root cause appears to be a miscommunication about the order's readiness and inadequate customer service from the staff.",OUTLET OPERATIONS,85,PERFORMANCE - BARISTA BEHAVIOUR / SERVICE,85,Performance - Barista Behaviour / Service,4660

user: When I asked if Zus does decaf coffee, the first staff member said “Yes” and offered to make it for me. I just needed to choose Boss or Lydia. I know there are not decaf and I could not understand how he could make them decaf. So I pushed him on this promise and tried to say that decaf means less coffee and more water! When challenged on this, another staff member said that decaf means chocolate drink or green tea!!! I cannot believe the ignorance of these Zus team members. They seemed to not understand what decaf is!

agent: Please give me a moment to check with the outlet on this matter.

user: If Zus does not do decaf, that’s fair enough, but I expect the staff of a coffee shop to know what it is. It’s certainly not extra diluted coffee, let alone chocolate milk or green tea!

Primary Concern: Delay in order preparation and delivery  
Identified Problem: The order was taking longer than expected to be prepared and picked up by the rider.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was placed at 8:14 AM, but the rider was scheduled to pick it up at 10:20 AM, indicating a significant delay.  
- Miscommunication regarding the order status and the expected pickup time.  
Resolution Offered: A new rider was arranged for the delivery after the customer requested it, and a complaint was filed regarding the previous rider's delay.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a significant delay in their coffee order, which was still being prepared over two hours after placement. The agent facilitated a resolution by arranging a new rider and filing a complaint about the previous rider's performance. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of order preparation delays and miscommunication regarding the expected pickup time.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,SLOW ORDER PREPARATION,85,SLOW ORDER PREPARATION,5039

agent: We apologise for the inconvenience and hope to serve you better in the future. 
agent: From the beginning, our vision was always to deliver specialty coffee as a daily necessity for ALL to enjoy. For many, specialty coffee is often seen as a luxury, something you treat yourself to on special occasions. We wanted to change this perception.

agent: Every ZUS Coffee is a cup of clean, consistent and well-handled coffee. With the best quality ingredients, high-level coffee brewing technology and innovative business model, we are evolving the concept of coffee consumption to make specialty coffee affordable for everyone, everyday.

agent: With over 39 million cups delivered to date, we only have our ZUSsies to thank for all our achievements thus far. Your amazing loyalty and support are what motivated us to keep our promise to you and ensure that ZUS Coffee is always a Necessity, not a Luxury.
agent: We hope this information is helpful. Apart from this, is there anything else we could assist you with?
user: Thanks for being honest Khuzairi, its not your fault if Zus doesn't have the specific ""Vision statement"" even in Malaysia. Maybe you can raise this to someone higher. So that way they can improve the website. Because the only thing that is obvious is the Mission of Zus. The Vision statement is missing. That's why the website is not helping.

437095,"user: Hi, I ordered coffee for pick up and I’m writing because I’m not satisfied with the waiting time. I usually get my drinks within 10 to 15 minutes, even when there are a lot of orders, and I totally understand that cuz there are only a few baristas to make the coffee. However, I waited more than 45 minutes to get my coffee today.My order number is 2122, yet orders 2123 and 2126 were served faster than mine. I noticed that some customers who arrived after me received their orders before I did. I asked the barista twice about my coffee, but they only responded that they were preparing it and asked how much coffee I ordered.
user: The barista also called out order 2124 to collect the coffee but it didn’t show in the system. Maybe the customer only order for 1 cup of coffee so the customer can get it asap? I know this because I’ve been sitting in front of the counter for 45 minutes ;)
