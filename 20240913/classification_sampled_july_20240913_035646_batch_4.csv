",Customer Account Details,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to use a voucher after a refund due to delivery issues  
Identified Problem: The customer was unable to use a ""buy 1 free 1"" voucher after their order was refunded because no rider was available. The refund was credited to the ZUS account instead of the customer's bank account.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The delivery service was unable to find a rider, leading to the order being refunded.  
- The refund was processed into the ZUS account rather than back to the customer's bank account, causing confusion and frustration.  
Resolution Offered: The agent offered to process a refund to the customer's bank account, which would take up to 14 working days.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being unable to use a voucher for a coffee order after their initial order was refunded due to a lack of available riders. The refund was credited to their ZUS account instead of their bank account, leading to dissatisfaction and the perception of unfair treatment. The agent ultimately offered to process a refund to the customer's bank account, but the customer indicated they no longer wished to use the app. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of service delivery failures and unclear refund processes.",LOYALTY AND REWARDS,80,APP - LOYALTY ISSUE,75,App - Loyalty Issue,6183

Dear Zus Coffee Company Customer Service Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am a loyal customer of your company and greatly enjoy the coffee products you offer. However, recently I have encountered some issues while trying to place orders online through your website for the Negeri Sembilan Bahau branch.

Specifically, every time I complete my selection and proceed to the checkout page, the system displays an error message saying, ""Unable to complete the transaction, please try again later."" I have tried using different browsers and devices, but the problem persists. This has caused significant inconvenience to my purchasing experience.

I hope that your team can resolve this issue as soon as possible and inform me when I can resume using the online ordering feature for the Negeri Sembilan Bahau branch. If you need more detailed information to investigate the issue, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your attention and assistance.

Sincerely,
Hong

",Outlet,OOS,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incomplete refund for an order that included multiple items.  
Identified Problem: The customer did not receive a refund for all items in the order, specifically the food items (almond croissant and pain au raisin), only for the creamy mango drink which was out of stock.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the cancellation of the entire order by the barista.  
- Lack of clarity on the refund process for multiple items in the order.  
Resolution Offered: A refund of RM10.90 for the creamy mango was processed, but the issue with the food items remained unresolved.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Nur Diyana, expressed frustration over receiving only a partial refund for her order, which included a creamy mango drink that was out of stock and food items that were not refunded. The issue stemmed from a miscommunication at the outlet regarding the cancellation of the entire order and the subsequent refund process. While the agent acknowledged the issue and processed a refund for the drink, the customer was left without resolution for the food items.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND ERROR / FAILURE,85,Refund Error / Failure,7326

Primary Concern: Received the wrong item in the order

Dear Zus,
Below my complaint for Zus branch Kulai No 221 (Ground floor) , Jalan kiambang 14, pusat komersial indah, Bandar Indahpura, Kulai.
Cashier took so long to take order. Waiting at counter without telling anything such “wait for a moment” “sekejap ye” no such thing. See at order list not so much order. While One staff keep cleaning sink using Zus cup which look not appropriate. No apologise at all after the late order from cashier. I reviewed past 5 month complaint in google review, also same case. Which no improvement from Zus.
Thank you.

Primary Concern: Incorrect order pickup location  
Identified Problem: Mismatch between the order pickup location and the actual store location as indicated by the navigation app.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer followed the navigation app (Waze) which led them to a location that did not correspond to the coffee outlet.  
- Lack of clarity or accuracy in the store's location information provided by the coffee chain.  
Resolution Offered: The order was successfully canceled, and a refund was processed back to the customer's payment method.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially contacted support to cancel an order due to arriving at a store location that was not as indicated by their navigation app. The agent confirmed the order was ready for pickup but later assisted in canceling the order and processing a refund. The root cause of the issue appears to be a discrepancy between the store's actual location and the information provided by the navigation app, leading to customer frustration. The customer expressed gratitude for the resolution but requested that the location information be corrected to prevent future issues.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,85,CANCELLATION - WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS,85,Cancellation - Wrong Outlet / Address,4679

Then i ask why there no whatapps message from ZUS,i want point, and he yea we'll do it. until my number on receipt have call out when my order ready but didnt call out my name.I'm abit confuse with your guys system.First is what is the point of taking our name if we been call by number. 2nd what campaign you guys offer for your regular consistently come order with you because we can get point to redeem.

",Cancellation,Cancellation - Wrong Outlet / Address,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to it being placed at the wrong outlet.  
Identified Problem: The app auto-selected the nearest branch, leading to the order being placed incorrectly.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer did not realize the order was placed at the wrong branch until arriving at the correct location.  
- The system's automatic selection of the nearest branch without manual confirmation from the customer.  
Resolution Offered: The order was eventually canceled, and a refund was issued to the customer's ZUS Balance after confirming the order had not been prepared.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially sought to cancel an order placed at the wrong outlet due to the app's automatic selection feature. Despite expressing frustration over the inability to cancel immediately, the agent confirmed that the order had not been prepared and successfully canceled it, issuing a refund. The root cause of the issue stemmed from the app's functionality, which led to the incorrect branch being selected without the customer's awareness.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,85,CANCELLATION - WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS,85,Cancellation - Wrong Outlet / Address,5116

Hi Mr Lee,     Greetings from Shopee and thank you for your kind patience!     Pertaining to your inquiry on why you are unable to rate certain orders, it appears that some orders may not display the 'Rate This Order' option if you have already rated them or if you have clicked 'X' on the feedback order dialog that appears on the homepage as attached below. This action causes the 'Rate This Order' text to be hidden from view.      ​Rest assured, we will take your feedback into account to improve our system and ensure a smoother experience for all our customers.     ​Hope this clarifies!     If you have other concerns or additional feedback, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our customer service team.  ​​Have a good day ahead!     -- Best Regards,   Atieqah Asma Customer Happiness Specialist     E. support@zuscoffee.com  W. www.zuscoffee.com",Feedback / Improvement,App - Buffering / Lag,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to rate certain orders in the ZUS app

Overall Summary: The customer, Mr. Lee, expressed frustration over being unable to rate certain orders in the ZUS app, specifically those in between his oldest and latest orders.

Primary Concern: The drink was delivered late and in poor condition.

Resolution Offered: The agent assured the customer that the issue would be escalated to the relevant team for investigation and that disciplinary action would be taken against the barista involved.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over the late delivery and poor condition of their drink, which was attributed to it being left out before pickup.

user: Okey",Outlet,Foam Issue,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Appreciative  
Primary Concern: Received less quantity of Hot Spanish Latte than expected  
Identified Problem: Thicker foam at preparation stage dissipated during delivery, leading to reduced liquid volume  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding expected drink volume  
- Potential quality control issues at the outlet during drink preparation  
Resolution Offered: Resending the drink with a new order number provided  
Overall Summary: The customer, Aisha, expressed dissatisfaction with the quantity of her Hot Spanish Latte, stating it was significantly less than expected. The agent acknowledged the issue, explaining that the drink's foam had dissipated during delivery, resulting in a lower liquid level. Aisha emphasized that she had never experienced such a small quantity before. The agent offered to resend the drink, which Aisha accepted, and she expressed gratitude for the prompt resolution. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of preparation inconsistencies and miscommunication regarding the expected drink volume.",ORDER ACCURACY,80,FOAM ISSUE,85,Foam Issue,5654
