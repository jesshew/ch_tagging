",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Hot Food,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: The customer received cold food instead of hot/warm food.  
Identified Problem: The food was not reheated before delivery, leading to it arriving in a cold state.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of proper food handling or reheating procedures by staff before delivery.  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the expectations for food temperature upon delivery.  
Resolution Offered: The agent suggested contacting the Customer Happiness team for further assistance and emphasized that feedback would be forwarded to the relevant team to prevent future occurrences.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving cold food instead of the expected hot/warm food. Despite having eaten the food already, the customer highlighted that this was not the usual standard and emphasized the importance of proper food handling procedures. The agent acknowledged the issue and assured the customer that their feedback would be used to improve service, but no immediate resolution was provided since the customer did not seek a refund. The root cause appears to be inadequate reheating or handling of food items prior to delivery.",ORDER ACCURACY,80,WRONG ORDER / ITEM(S),75,Wrong Order / Item(s),6001

Hi Tengku Danial Malik,     ​We will reply in a separate email.   Thank you!     -- Best Regards,   Atieqah Asma Customer Happiness Specialist     E. support@zuscoffee.com  W. www.zuscoffee.com",Outlet,OOS,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Disappointed  
Primary Concern: Customer did not receive the promised free Matcha Macam sticker due to it being out of stock.  
Identified Problem: The sticker was out of stock at the specific outlet where the customer made the purchase.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The policy that customers can only claim the free sticker from the outlet where the order was made.  
- Lack of communication regarding stock availability at the time of purchase.  
Resolution Offered: A refund was processed to the customer's ZUS Balance, and instructions were provided on how to check the balance in the app.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Carmen, expressed disappointment over not receiving a free sticker that was promised with her order due to it being out of stock at the outlet she visited. The main issue stemmed from the store's stock availability and the policy that restricts claiming the sticker from a different outlet. The resolution involved processing a refund to her account, but the underlying problem indicates a need for better communication regarding stock levels and policy clarity.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,75,MISLEADING / DISSATISFACTION,85,MISLEADING / DISSATISFACTION,4577

Primary Concern: Missing Hot Velvet Crème in the order  
Identified Problem: The Hot Velvet Crème was either not added or completely dissolved in the hot drink, leading to the customer not being able to taste it.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the preparation of the drink, specifically the addition of the velvet crème.  
- Potential inconsistency in the outlet's preparation standards for hot drinks.

Overall Summary: The customer raised a concern about missing the Hot Velvet Crème in their order (ID: 24072801217). The agent confirmed that the outlet team had added the crème, but it may have dissolved in the hot drink, which the customer disputed, stating they could not taste it at all. The customer expressed frustration, noting this was not the first occurrence of this issue. The agent offered a complimentary drink voucher and assured the customer that the matter would be investigated to prevent future occurrences.

The root cause of the issue appears to be the reliance on a third-party service for transactions, which limited the coffee chain's ability to address the customer's concern directly.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND STATUS,75,Refund Status,4696

agent: Thank you and have a pleasant day ahead! 😊",Outlet,Packaging,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer is being charged RM1 for a paper bag for a pickup order of more than 4 drinks.  
Identified Problem: Lack of consistency in the application of the paper bag charge policy across different outlets.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer has previously received paper bags without charge from other outlets for similar orders.  
- The customer was not informed about the need to select the paper bag option in the app for pickup orders.  
Resolution Offered: The agent explained the current policy regarding the paper bag charge and advised the customer to select the option in the app for future orders.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being charged RM1 for a paper bag for a pickup order of more than 4 drinks, noting that this was not a consistent practice at other outlets. The agent clarified the policy but did not address the inconsistency issue, leading to the customer's suggestion for an improvement in the standard operating procedure (SOP) to automatically provide paper bags for larger orders. The root cause of the issue appears to be a lack of clear communication regarding the policy and its inconsistent application across different locations.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,85,COMPLAINTS,85,Complaints,5887

Primary Concern: Incorrect order received (fresh milk instead of requested oat or almond milk)  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication or error in order preparation  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer requested specific milk alternatives (oat or almond) but received fresh milk instead.  
- Customer requested less sugar but received regular sugar, indicating potential issues in order customization.  
Resolution Offered: Refund issued to the customer's ZUS Balance due to inability to pick up a replacement order.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially raised concerns about receiving the wrong items in their order, specifically requesting oat or almond milk but receiving fresh milk instead. Additionally, there was a miscommunication regarding sugar preferences. The agent offered to prepare a new drink for pickup, but the customer was unable to do so due to work commitments. As a resolution, a refund was issued to the customer's ZUS Balance, which the customer accepted and expressed satisfaction with the outcome. The root cause appears to be a combination of order preparation errors and miscommunication regarding customization requests.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,85,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,5692

- Possible high demand or insufficient resources leading to delays in service.

Identified Problem: Customer mistakenly ordered from the wrong outlet and was unable to change or cancel the order after it was confirmed.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding outlet names leading to confusion.

Resolution Offered: A 50% discount voucher for the next purchase was provided as a goodwill gesture.

Ultimately, a 50% discount voucher was offered as a resolution, but the root cause of the issue stemmed from miscommunication regarding outlet selection and language support.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,85,WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS - VOUCHER CODE,85,Wrong Outlet / Address - Voucher Code,5853

user: tq",Cancellation,Cancellation - Long Waiting Time,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to incorrect shop selection and early preparation.  
Identified Problem: The order was processed and prepared by the outlet despite the customer pressing the cancel button.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The app's cancel button did not function as expected, leading to confusion.  
- The outlet prepared the order earlier than the scheduled pickup time, which was set for 6:30 PM.  
Resolution Offered: The order was eventually cancelled and the payment refunded to the customer's ZUS Balance.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially sought to cancel an order due to selecting the wrong shop and experiencing early preparation by the staff. Despite pressing the cancel button, the order was still processed, leading to frustration. The agent acknowledged the issue, checked with the outlet, and ultimately facilitated the cancellation and refund. The root cause appears to be a malfunction in the app's cancel functionality and miscommunication regarding order preparation timing.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,80,CANCELLATION - WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS,85,Cancellation - Wrong Outlet / Address,5779

",Delivery,Failed Delivery,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Order not received despite payment  
Identified Problem: Delivery issue, possibly due to incorrect drop-off location  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of communication from the delivery rider (no call received)  
- Misplacement of the order by the delivery rider  
Resolution Offered: Resending the same order to the same address  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving their order, which they had already paid for. The agent confirmed that the order was marked as delivered but the customer insisted they had not received it and mentioned that the rider did not contact them.

user: hello
user: Good afternoon, I need your help. My name is wang zekun, I have a zus account, registered with a mobile number of +60148772572. I still have a balance of about 25.85 in this account, and this account is bound to my credit card with the last digit 0247. Because I changed my mobile number, the mobile number used to register the zus account is no longer in use, and I can't receive the verification code, so I can't log in to my account and use the balance. Now I need you to help me refund the balance of my account registered with the mobile number +60148772572 to the credit card bound to this account, or transfer the balance to my new account registered with a new mobile number, which is +60104319345. At the same time, I need you to help me unbind the credit card with the last digit 0247 bound to the original account +60148772572, otherwise if my invalid mobile number is used again by the operator, my credit card may be stolen. Thank you, looking forward to your reply.

Primary Concern: Received the wrong items in the order  
Identified Problem: Barista packed the wrong order  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication or error during the order preparation process  
- Lack of quality control in the packing of orders  
Resolution Offered: Resending the correct item (ZUS Signature Chicken Lasagna) and providing a recovery order ID  
Overall Summary: The customer reported receiving the wrong item in their order (curry puff instead of lasagna). The agent acknowledged the mistake, identified that the barista had packed the wrong order, and prioritized the issue for resolution. The agent offered to resend the correct item due to the customer's specific craving during pregnancy. A recovery order was created, and the customer expressed satisfaction with the service provided. The root cause of the issue appears to be a packing error by the barista, highlighting a need for improved quality control in order fulfillment.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,WRONG ORDER / ITEM(S),85,Wrong Order / Item(s),5459

",Payment,Double Payment Charges,Payment Gateway,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Double payment charges on the mobile app  
Identified Problem: System error leading to double payment charges  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer's lack of trust in providing personal information for the refund  
- Miscommunication regarding the necessity of personal details for processing the refund  
Resolution Offered: Refund will be processed within 14 working days upon receiving the required personal details  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced a double payment issue through the ZUS Coffee mobile app and sought a refund. The agent informed the customer that a refund could be processed but required personal banking details, which the customer was uncomfortable providing. This led to frustration and accusations of scamming, as the customer felt unsafe sharing sensitive information. The root cause of the issue appears to be a system error that resulted in the double charge, compounded by the customer's concerns about data security and the agent's insistence on collecting personal information for the refund process.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,90,Double Payment Charges,6185

Primary Concern: Coffee cup lid not closing properly, resulting in spilled coffee.  
Identified Problem: The cup was not securely closed, leading to a mess and inconvenience for the customer.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer picked up the order themselves, which may have led to a lack of additional packaging support (like tape or parchment) that is typically provided for delivery orders.  
- The customer was a first-time buyer, which may have contributed to their expectations regarding product quality and packaging.  

Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the order was prepared correctly and stated that a refund could not be issued. The customer was informed that the issue would be forwarded to the relevant team.  

Overall Summary: The customer experienced a significant issue with their first order of a coconut latte, as the lid did not close properly, causing a spill and requiring them to clean up. Despite the agent's attempts to assist, the customer felt frustrated by the lack of resolution and the inability to receive a refund. The root cause of the issue appears to be the packaging standards for pickup orders, which did not meet the customer's expectations, especially as a first-time buyer.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,85,SPILLAGE,85,Spillage,4671

user: please answer me
agent: Apologies, you may wrote down the complaint here and will forward it to the relevant team to check and take necessary action.
user: I often study at ZUS Coffee, and sometimes I don’t order anything. However, today I encountered something that made me very angry and upset. At ZUS Kajang MKH Boulevard, I experienced discrimination from the staff, who told me that if I didn’t order anything, I couldn’t stay there. Is this really your company’s policy? If I ordered something in the morning and went back in the afternoon, do I have to order something again to sit there? I ordered coffee yesterday morning, and today I was told I couldn’t sit there without ordering something? This gave me a very bad experience. A female staff member at your coffee shop repeatedly spoke to me rudely because I didn’t order anything. I need a satisfactory explanation.
user: please answer me
agent: We are terribly sorry for the negative experience.

agent: We will highlight this to the outlet PIC to investigate and take necessary action to ensure this incident shall never happen in the future. 🙏
agent: May we get your email and phone number that has been registered in ZUS Apps?

user: Thank you for your attitude, which makes me feel better, but I still hope that your company can inform me of the progress and results of this matter by email.
agent: We understand how unpleasant this experience must have been for you and we would like to apologize for this.
agent: This shouldn’t have happened to you or any of our customers.
agent: We are putting the highest priority on this issue and will forward it to the relevant team to check and take necessary action to prevent this from happening again.
agent: Once again, we're extremely sorry for the unpleasant experience.
agent: We understand your frustration and we will try our best to improve and serve you better in the future.
user: So can I not have to order every time I sit in Zus?
user: please answer me
agent: We understand that you may want to study at the outlet, but the seating is reserved for our customers at that specific time and date.

agent: If you do wish to study at the outlet, you will need to make a purchase from the outlet on that day and time. We appreciate your understanding.
user: When I was there, many seats in the store were empty, and if I ordered something in the morning, would I need to continue ordering if I went there in the afternoon?
user: You can check my order records on the app. In addition to those, I also ordered directly in the store, which are not shown in the app. I ordered so many things from your company, and I don’t think I should be treated like this.

Contributing Factors:  
- The preparation process resulted in a thicker foam that dissipated during delivery, leading to a perceived shortfall in liquid.

Resolution Offered: The agent acknowledged the issue and promised to forward the feedback to the relevant team for improvement.  

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving a cup of coffee that was not full, which was attributed to the preparation method that caused foam to dissipate.

Primary Concern: The customer wants to apologize to a staff member for their previous behavior.  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the customer's intent to apologize and the handling of their complaint.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer expressed frustration with their order, leading to an emotional response directed at the staff.  
- The chat agent struggled to understand the customer's request, leading to repeated prompts for menu selections instead of addressing the apology directly.  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the apology would be communicated to the staff member in question.  
Overall Summary: The customer initiated the chat to express regret for their previous behavior towards a staff member named Imrah after a complaint about their order. The interaction was complicated by the agent's misunderstanding of the customer's request, which led to a series of irrelevant prompts. Ultimately, the agent assured the customer that their apology would be conveyed to the staff member, resolving the primary concern. The root cause of the issue stemmed from the customer's emotional response to a service issue and the agent's difficulty in interpreting the customer's intent.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,75,COMPLAINTS,75,Complaints,6411
