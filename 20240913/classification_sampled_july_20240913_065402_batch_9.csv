",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Hot Food,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: The customer received cold food instead of hot/warm food.  
Identified Problem: The food was not reheated before delivery, leading to it arriving in a cold state.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of proper food handling or reheating procedures by staff before delivery.  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the expectations for food temperature upon delivery.  
Resolution Offered: The agent suggested contacting the Customer Happiness team for further assistance and emphasized that feedback would be forwarded to the relevant team to prevent future occurrences.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving cold food instead of the expected hot/warm food. Despite having eaten the food already, the customer highlighted that this was not the usual standard and emphasized the importance of proper food handling procedures. The agent acknowledged the issue and assured the customer that their feedback would be used to improve service, but no immediate resolution was provided since the customer did not seek a refund. The root cause appears to be inadequate reheating or handling of food items prior to delivery.",ORDER ACCURACY,80,WRONG ORDER / ITEM(S),75,Wrong Order / Item(s),6001

Primary Concern: Customer did not receive their drinks despite the order status showing as delivered.  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the delivery of the drinks; the rider did not contact the customer before leaving the drinks with arena staff.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The delivery rider was unreachable when the customer inquired about their order.  
- The customer was not informed about the drinks being left with arena staff, leading to confusion.  
Resolution Offered: A recovery order was arranged to resend the drinks, and the customer was informed they would not need to pay for the second cup.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially expressed frustration over not receiving their drinks, despite the order being marked as delivered. After some back-and-forth communication, it was revealed that the rider had left the drinks with arena staff without notifying the customer. A recovery order was successfully arranged, and the customer was assured they would not be charged for the second cup.

Primary Concern: Customer did not receive the promised free Matcha Macam sticker due to it being out of stock.  
Identified Problem: The sticker was out of stock at the specific outlet where the customer made the purchase.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The policy that customers can only claim the free sticker from the outlet where the order was made.  
- Lack of communication regarding stock availability at the time of purchase.  
Resolution Offered: A refund was processed to the customer's ZUS Balance, and instructions were provided on how to check the balance in the app.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Carmen, expressed disappointment over not receiving a free sticker that was promised with her order due to it being out of stock at the outlet she visited. The main issue stemmed from the store's stock availability and the policy that restricts claiming the sticker from a different outlet. The resolution involved processing a refund to her account, but the underlying problem indicates a need for better communication regarding stock levels and policy clarity.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,75,MISLEADING / DISSATISFACTION,85,MISLEADING / DISSATISFACTION,4577

Primary Concern: Missing Hot Velvet Cr√®me in the order  
Identified Problem: The Hot Velvet Cr√®me was either not added or completely dissolved in the hot drink, leading to the customer not being able to taste it.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the preparation of the drink, specifically the addition of the velvet cr√®me.  
- Potential inconsistency in the outlet's preparation standards for hot drinks.  
Resolution Offered: A complimentary drink voucher for the Hot Velvet Cr√®me Latt√© was provided to the customer.  
Overall Summary: The customer raised a concern about missing the Hot Velvet Cr√®me in their order (ID: 24072801217). The agent confirmed that the outlet team had added the cr√®me, but it may have dissolved in the hot drink, which the customer disputed, stating they could not taste it at all. The customer expressed frustration, noting this was not the first occurrence of this issue. The agent offered a complimentary drink voucher and assured the customer that the matter would be investigated to prevent future occurrences. The root cause appears to be a combination of miscommunication about the drink preparation and potential inconsistencies in how the drink is made at the outlet.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,85,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,8612

",Delivery,Slow Delivery Service,Pandago,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order preparation and delivery  
Identified Problem: The order was delayed due to the rider arriving late to pick up the order from the outlet.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was placed over 45 minutes prior to the inquiry, exceeding the expected preparation and delivery time.  
- Lack of timely updates regarding the order status, leading to customer uncertainty.  

Resolution Offered: The agent provided the rider's contact information and confirmed that the order had been picked up, but did not offer a solution to expedite the delivery.  

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a significant delay in their coffee order, which had been in preparation for over 45 minutes. The agent clarified that the delay was due to the rider arriving late to pick up the order. While the agent provided the rider's contact information, the lack of proactive communication and timely updates contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction. The root cause of the issue appears to be a delay in the rider's arrival, compounded by insufficient communication regarding the order status.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,CANCELLATION - LONG WAITING TIME,85,Cancellation - Long Waiting Time,4938

      Subject: Double Payment Charged by Grab App  
      Description:  
 Dear Lau Yu, 
   
 Greetings from ZUS Coffee. 
   
 
Since the order was made via Grab Food, unfortunately, we are not able to process the refund from our end due to double payment charge.¬†In this case, kindly reach out to Grab Food by going to Grab Food App > Click the 'receipt' logo at the top right, tap on your order > Tap on 'Contact Grab'.¬†¬†The team will proceed with a refund from their end.
 
 Meanwhile we recommend that you kindly contact customer service to request a refund, as we are unable to proceed further from our end due to the order being placed using Grab.¬† 
   
 Thank you for your understanding. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any further concern or inquiries. We'll be right with you.

 W.¬†www.zuscoffee.com",Payment,Double Payment Charges,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Request for a refund due to extra charges on a Grab Food order  
Identified Problem: The inability to process the refund directly due to the order being placed through a third-party app (Grab Food)  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer experienced unexpected extra charges on their account after using the Grab Food service.  
- Lack of immediate resolution from the coffee chain's staff, leading to the customer being directed to customer service instead.  
Resolution Offered: The customer was advised to contact Grab Food directly for the refund, as the coffee chain could not process it on their end.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Lau Yu, expressed frustration over being charged extra for an order placed through Grab Food and sought a refund. The coffee chain clarified that they could not process the refund due to the nature of the transaction and recommended that the customer contact Grab Food directly for assistance. The root cause of the issue appears to be the reliance on a third-party service for transactions, which limited the coffee chain's ability to address the customer's concern directly.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND STATUS,75,Refund Status,4696

Primary Concern: Customer is being charged RM1 for a paper bag for a pickup order of more than 4 drinks.  
Identified Problem: Lack of consistency in the application of the paper bag charge policy across different outlets.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer has previously received paper bags without charge from other outlets for similar orders.  
- The customer was not informed about the need to select the paper bag option in the app for pickup orders.  
Resolution Offered: The agent explained the current policy regarding the paper bag charge and advised the customer to select the option in the app for future orders.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being charged RM1 for a paper bag for a pickup order of more than 4 drinks, noting that this was not a consistent practice at other outlets. The agent clarified the policy but did not address the inconsistency issue, leading to the customer's suggestion for an improvement in the standard operating procedure (SOP) to automatically provide paper bags for larger orders. The root cause of the issue appears to be a lack of clear communication regarding the policy and its inconsistent application across different locations.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,85,COMPLAINTS,85,Complaints,5887

Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery  
Identified Problem: The delivery rider was delayed and waiting at the wrong location (McDonald's) instead of delivering to the customer's address.

- Possible high demand or insufficient resources leading to delays in service.  
Resolution Offered: The agent apologized for the delay, acknowledged the issue, and assured the customer that it would be addressed with the relevant team.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a significant delay in their order delivery, which was supposed to arrive at 18:59 but did not arrive until 19:26. The rider was found waiting at a nearby McDonald's instead of the customer's location. The agent acknowledged the issue, apologized, and promised to address it with the team, emphasizing the need for improvement in service.

Primary Concern: The rider requested to cancel the order due to distance, but the customer could not cancel it through the app.  
Identified Problem: Lack of cancellation option in the ZUS app for direct orders.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The rider's reason for cancellation was due to the distance to pick up the order.  
- The customer ordered directly through the ZUS app, which may not have provided the necessary functionality for order management.

Primary Concern: Withdrawal of funds from ZUS app not reflected in the bank account  
Identified Problem: Discrepancy in the withdrawal amount and failure to receive the funds in the bank  
Contributing Factors:  
- Incorrect amount deducted (RM16.75 instead of RM16.00)

",Cancellation,Cancellation - Long Waiting Time,Pandago,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding order status and delivery tracking  
Contributing Factors:  
- The system indicated that the driver had picked up the order and was en route, but the customer could not contact the driver or the outlet.  
- The customer experienced repeated delays beyond the promised delivery time.

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a significant delay in their order delivery, which was compounded by a lack of communication and inability to contact the driver or outlet.

The agent offered a refund, which the customer accepted, and the issue was resolved with the promise of a refund to their bank account.

",Outlet,Wrong Drink,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to change an order after it has been placed  
Identified Problem: Policy that does not allow for order amendments or cancellations once the order is in preparation  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication regarding order amendment policies at the time of order placement  
- Customer's misunderstanding or lack of awareness of the policy  
Resolution Offered: None; the agent reiterated the policy and suggested careful review of orders before finalization  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over their inability to change their order from a CEO latte to a cafe latte after it had been placed. The main issue stemmed from the company's policy that prohibits amendments or cancellations once an order is being prepared. Contributing factors included a potential lack of clear communication about this policy during the ordering process and the customer's misunderstanding of the rules. No resolution was offered, and the agent encouraged the customer to review their orders more carefully in the future.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,75,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,75,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,4081

After some back and forth, it was revealed that the order was delivered to the wrong address, leading to the customer retrieving the drinks from a neighbor. The agent offered a refund, which was accepted by the customer, and they expressed appreciation for the resolution. The root cause of the issue appears to be a delivery error or miscommunication regarding the order's delivery status.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,FAILED DELIVERY,85,Failed Delivery,7210

user: tq",Cancellation,Cancellation - Long Waiting Time,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to incorrect shop selection and early preparation.  
Identified Problem: The order was processed and prepared by the outlet despite the customer pressing the cancel button.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The app's cancel button did not function as expected, leading to confusion.  
- The outlet prepared the order earlier than the scheduled pickup time, which was set for 6:30 PM.  
Resolution Offered: The order was eventually cancelled and the payment refunded to the customer's ZUS Balance.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially sought to cancel an order due to selecting the wrong shop and experiencing early preparation by the staff. Despite pressing the cancel button, the order was still processed, leading to frustration. The agent acknowledged the issue, checked with the outlet, and ultimately facilitated the cancellation and refund. The root cause appears to be a malfunction in the app's cancel functionality and miscommunication regarding order preparation timing.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,80,CANCELLATION - WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS,85,Cancellation - Wrong Outlet / Address,5779

user: live agent
agent: How may I assist you?

user: hello
user: Good afternoon, I need your help. My name is wang zekun, I have a zus account, registered with a mobile number of +60148772572. I still have a balance of about 25.85 in this account, and this account is bound to my credit card with the last digit 0247. Because I changed my mobile number, the mobile number used to register the zus account is no longer in use, and I can't receive the verification code, so I can't log in to my account and use the balance. Now I need you to help me refund the balance of my account registered with the mobile number +60148772572 to the credit card bound to this account, or transfer the balance to my new account registered with a new mobile number, which is +60104319345. At the same time, I need you to help me unbind the credit card with the last digit 0247 bound to the original account +60148772572, otherwise if my invalid mobile number is used again by the operator, my credit card may be stolen. Thank you, looking forward to your reply.

Overall Summary: The customer experienced a double payment issue through the ZUS Coffee mobile app and sought a refund.

This led to frustration and accusations of scamming, as the customer felt unsafe sharing sensitive information. The root cause of the issue appears to be a system error that resulted in the double charge, compounded by the customer's concerns about data security and the agent's insistence on collecting personal information for the refund process.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,90,Double Payment Charges,6185

Primary Concern: Coffee cup lid not closing properly, resulting in spilled coffee.  
Identified Problem: The cup was not securely closed, leading to a mess and inconvenience for the customer.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer picked up the order themselves, which may have led to a lack of additional packaging support (like tape or parchment) that is typically provided for delivery orders.  
- The customer was a first-time buyer, which may have contributed to their expectations regarding product quality and packaging.  

Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the order was prepared correctly and stated that a refund could not be issued. The customer was informed that the issue would be forwarded to the relevant team.  

Overall Summary: The customer experienced a significant issue with their first order of a coconut latte, as the lid did not close properly, causing a spill and requiring them to clean up. Despite the agent's attempts to assist, the customer felt frustrated by the lack of resolution and the inability to receive a refund. The root cause of the issue appears to be the packaging standards for pickup orders, which did not meet the customer's expectations, especially as a first-time buyer.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,85,SPILLAGE,85,Spillage,4671

agent: Hi there, greetings from ZUS Coffee. My name is Anna, and I'll be assisting you today.
user: Please give me your company's complaint method
user: please answer me
agent: Apologies, you may wrote down the complaint here and will forward it to the relevant team to check and take necessary action.
user: I often study at ZUS Coffee, and sometimes I don‚Äôt order anything. However, today I encountered something that made me very angry and upset. At ZUS Kajang MKH Boulevard, I experienced discrimination from the staff, who told me that if I didn‚Äôt order anything, I couldn‚Äôt stay there. Is this really your company‚Äôs policy? If I ordered something in the morning and went back in the afternoon, do I have to order something again to sit there? I ordered coffee yesterday morning, and today I was told I couldn‚Äôt sit there without ordering something? This gave me a very bad experience. A female staff member at your coffee shop repeatedly spoke to me rudely because I didn‚Äôt order anything. I need a satisfactory¬†explanation.
user: please answer me
agent: We are terribly sorry for the negative experience.

agent: We will highlight this to the outlet PIC to investigate and take necessary action to ensure this incident shall never happen in the future. üôè
agent: May we get your email and phone number that has been registered in ZUS Apps?
user: 18365697896@163.com
user: Thank you for your attitude, which makes me feel better, but I still hope that your company can inform me of the progress and results of this matter by email.
agent: We understand how unpleasant this experience must have been for you and we would like to apologize for this.
agent: This shouldn‚Äôt have happened to you or any of our customers.
agent: We are putting the highest priority on this issue and will forward it to the relevant team to check and take necessary action to prevent this from happening again.
agent: Once again, we're extremely sorry for the unpleasant experience.
agent: We understand your frustration and we will try our best to improve and serve you better in the future.
user: So can I not have to order every time I sit in Zus?
user: please answer me
agent: We understand that you may want to study at the outlet, but the seating is reserved for our customers at that specific time and date.

agent: If you do wish to study at the outlet, you will need to make a purchase from the outlet on that day and time. We appreciate your understanding.
user: When I was there, many seats in the store were empty, and if I ordered something in the morning, would I need to continue ordering if I went there in the afternoon?
user: You can check my order records on the app. In addition to those, I also ordered directly in the store, which are not shown in the app. I ordered so many things from your company, and I don‚Äôt think I should be treated like this.

Primary Concern: Discrimination and unclear seating policy at ZUS Coffee  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the seating policy for customers who do not make a purchase  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication about the company's policy on seating for non-purchasing customers  
- Negative interaction with staff leading to feelings of discrimination  
Resolution Offered: Investigation into the incident and assurance of a follow-up via email regarding the outcome  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a discriminatory experience at ZUS Coffee, where they were told they could not sit without making a purchase, despite having ordered previously. The agent acknowledged the issue, apologized, and promised to investigate and follow up via email. The root cause appears to be a lack of clear communication regarding the seating policy, compounded by the customer's negative interaction with staff.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,85,COMPLAINTS,85,Complaints,4733

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a recurring issue where the velvet cream was not added to their order, which has happened three times. The agent acknowledged the issue and offered a refund for the extra charge associated with the missing item. The root cause appears to be a failure in the order preparation process, compounded by ineffective communication with the virtual assistant.

When I spoke with the batista. He said that was the way of preparation. As far as I know, I ordered using thumbler for a long time. This is the first branch that made my order like that. And it's not the first time they done this. please train your batista properly. I am very disappointed.
agent: Apologies to hear about the experience you have encountered. Did you add the tumbler in your APP?

user: Yes. I already added my thumbler in my Zus App. You can double check it.


If the barista just said, ""I'm sorry."" I'm not gonna argue with this matter. But the response that I got from his is make me speechless. Because the things that I know when I was placing my order using thumbler, they will make my coffee using my thumbler, not regular cup.

Primary Concern: Improper handling of orders using the thumbler at the Larkin Jaya branch  
Identified Problem: Barista did not prepare the coffee in the customer's thumbler as expected, leading to melted ice  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of proper training for baristas on handling thumbler orders  
- Miscommunication regarding the preparation process for thumbler orders  
Resolution Offered: The agent acknowledged the issue and promised to forward the feedback to the relevant team for improvement  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed disappointment over the handling of their thumbler order at the Larkin Jaya branch, where the coffee was prepared in a regular cup and transferred to the thumbler, resulting in melted ice. The customer emphasized their expectation for the coffee to be made directly in the thumbler, as they had experienced at other branches. The agent apologized and assured the customer that their feedback would be addressed to improve service in the future. The root cause of the issue appears to be inadequate training of baristas and a lack of clear communication regarding the thumbler preparation process.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,80,MISSED OUT - REMARKS,70,Missed Out - Remarks,6196
