Primary Concern: The customer received a soy latte instead of the ordered almond latte, which is a serious issue due to their soy allergy.  
Identified Problem: A system error or miscommunication during the order process led to the incorrect milk being selected.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer suspects that the issue arose when they attempted to apply a buy 1 free 1 voucher, which may have altered their order.  
- The barista's refusal to change the drink due to pricing differences, despite the customer's allergy concerns.  
Resolution Offered: The agent offered a 20% discount voucher as an apology and confirmed that the outlet would replace the incorrect drink.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially ordered an almond zero latte but received a soy latte due to a possible system error during the voucher application process. The customer expressed frustration over their soy allergy and the staff's refusal to accommodate their request for a change. The agent acknowledged the issue, offered a discount, and confirmed that the drink would be replaced, but the customer noted that the situation took up significant time. The root cause appears to be a combination of system miscommunication and staff policy regarding pricing.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,80,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,4986

",Delivery,Rider Behavior,Pandago,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Order not picked up by the rider  
Identified Problem: The rider failed to pick up the customer's order, leading to the customer having to pick it up themselves.

",Feedback / Improvement,App - Loyalty Issue,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Loyalty tier dropped despite fulfilling requirements  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding loyalty program requirements  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clarity on how vouchers affect cup counts  
- Delay in response from customer service regarding the issue  
Resolution Offered: Issue raised to the relevant team for further investigation; customer advised on loyalty program requirements  
Overall Summary: The customer, Xiao Bei, expressed frustration over a drop in their loyalty tier from ZUS Elite to Super Addict, despite having purchased the required number of cups without using vouchers. The agent acknowledged the issue and raised it for further investigation, but there was a delay in providing a clear response. Ultimately, it was clarified that the customer needed to collect 16 cups in the quarter to maintain their elite status, and that purchases made with vouchers do not count towards cup totals. The root cause of the issue appears to be a lack of clear communication regarding the loyalty program's rules and the impact of vouchers on cup counts.",LOYALTY AND REWARDS,90,APP - LOYALTY ISSUE,85,App - Loyalty Issue,5491

Primary Concern: Incorrect order received (dairy milk instead of almond milk)  
Identified Problem: Customer accidentally selected the wrong coffee option (boss bean) and received the wrong milk type in their order.

They refused to add it. I told them other Zus outlets add it… and the first time I had coconut latte at Masjid Jsmek it had foam. We called the manager.

agent: Can you please tell us which are the affected item(s)?
Example:
Didn't receive the whole order.

user: I asked for 5 pieces of ice and coconut foam in my order. When the drink was being prepared— the staff filled it with ice. I complained even though I was in a hurry. The staff threw out the drink and prepared it again. Then, they didn’t add coconut foam. They refused to add it. I told them other Zus outlets add it… and the first time I had coconut latte at Masjid Jsmek it had foam. We called the manager. He refused to ask the staff to add foam or give me a refund.
user: OUTRAGEOUS!
user: 😭
user: I have been in the ZUS wasting time for an hour.
user: 😤
user: Both the staff and manager were arrogant and rude.
user: Manager name is something like Najimi.
user: He’s not even here.
user: Very disappointed.
user: Before this, Zus was always helpful.
user: I am leaving now. Still no coffee prepared according to my instructions.

Primary Concern: Order not received as per specifications (missing coconut foam)  
Identified Problem: Staff refusal to add coconut foam to the drink despite customer requests  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the drink specifications and standard offerings  
- Staff and manager's perceived rudeness and lack of customer service  
Resolution Offered: Refund or a coupon for a coconut latte at another outlet  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving their drink as requested, specifically missing coconut foam. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, including involving a manager, the staff refused to accommodate the request. The customer felt bullied and disappointed by the service, contrasting it with previous positive experiences at other locations. The agent offered a refund or a coupon as a resolution, but the customer remained dissatisfied with the overall experience.

Subject: ISU TIADA RIDER & PEMULANGAN WANG
To: <zcm-support@zuscoffee.com>


Hello Zuss Team,

Saya ada pertanyaan mengenai pemulangan duit (Zuss Balance).
Saya buat pembelian menggunakan Aplikasi Zuss dan membayar menggunakan Zuss
Balance pada 05/07/2024, Order Number : 24070504911. Order Type : Delivery,
Item : Vietnamese Spanish Latte & Iced OATSIDE Japanese Genmaicha Latte,
Jumlah Pembelian : RM30.80.

Saya tidak menerima pesanan minuman kerana tiada Rider. Saya menerima notis
'Refunded' tetapi saya tidak menerima sebarang pemulangan wang sebanyak
RM30.80.

Saya mohon pihak Zuss menyemak Zuss Balance dan isu pemulangan wang saya.

Di sini saya kepilkan bukti pembelian.

Sekian,
Terima Kasih.

",Cancellation,Cancellation - No Rider,Pandago,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Refund not received for a failed delivery  
Identified Problem: Lack of delivery rider leading to order cancellation  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error or miscommunication regarding rider availability  
- Delay in processing the refund to the customer's Zuss Balance  
Resolution Offered: Request for the Zuss team to check the Zuss Balance and resolve the refund issue  
Overall Summary: The customer, Ain Amir, expressed frustration over not receiving a refund for an order that was not delivered due to the absence of a delivery rider. Despite receiving a notification that the order was refunded, the customer did not see the amount reflected in their Zuss Balance. The root cause appears to be a combination of a system error or miscommunication regarding rider availability and a delay in processing the refund. The customer requested assistance in resolving the issue.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND ERROR / FAILURE,85,Refund Error / Failure,4416

Overall Summary: The customer, Firdaus, raised a concern about being charged twice for a single item. The agent confirmed the double charge and initiated a refund process, requesting the customer's bank details to facilitate the refund. The main issue stemmed from a system error that caused the double deduction. While the agent provided a resolution, the customer expressed frustration, likely due to the delay in addressing the issue and the lengthy refund timeline.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,90,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,90,Double Payment Charges,4434

",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Drink,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Disappointed  
Primary Concern: The hot chocolate order had spoiled milk, resulting in a bad taste.  
Identified Problem: Potential spoilage of milk or cocoa powder used in the hot chocolate.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The hot chocolate had a sour, off-putting smell and an unpleasant taste, indicating possible spoilage.  
- The other drink (Spanish latte) was in good condition, suggesting an isolated issue with the hot chocolate preparation or ingredients.  
Resolution Offered: A refund of RM12.9 to the customer's ZUS balance for the hot chocolate.  
Overall Summary: The customer reported that their hot chocolate order had spoiled milk, resulting in a bad taste, while another drink was fine. The agent acknowledged the issue, requested more details, and offered a refund, which the customer accepted. The root cause appears to be related to the quality of the milk or cocoa powder used in the hot chocolate, which will be investigated further by the outlet team.",PRODUCT QUALITY / HYGIENE ISSUE,85,QUALITY COMPLAINT - DRINK,85,Quality Complaint - Drink,4357

agent: Thank you and have a nice day ahead! 😊",Delivery,Spillage,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Poor condition of delivered order due to spillage and inadequate sealing of hot drinks.  
Identified Problem: Inadequate packaging and sealing of hot drinks during delivery.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of proper sealing (no parchment paper or tape) for hot drinks.  
- Delivery mishandling leading to spillage and receiving a half cup of a hot drink.  
Resolution Offered: Resending the three hot drinks and providing a tracking number for the new order.  
Overall Summary: The customer reported that their order arrived in poor condition, with spillage and improperly sealed hot drinks. The agent acknowledged the issue and confirmed the details, then offered to resend the drinks and provided a new order number. The root cause appears to be inadequate packaging and handling during delivery, which the agent assured would be addressed with the relevant department. The customer expressed gratitude for the resolution.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,85,PACKAGING,85,Packaging,5502

Primary Concern: Customer did not receive the OTP (One-Time Password) for login.  
Identified Problem: The system may have issues validating the customer's phone number or sending the OTP.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer repeatedly entered what they believed to be a valid phone number, but the system flagged it as invalid.  
- Miscommunication between the customer and the agent regarding the OTP process and the validity of the codes provided.  
Resolution Offered: The agent provided multiple OTP codes and clarified the process for entering them, while also suggesting the customer check their email or WhatsApp for the OTP.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially reached out due to not receiving an OTP for login. Throughout the interaction, there were issues with the system recognizing the customer's phone number as valid, leading to confusion and frustration. The agent provided several OTP codes, but the customer continued to experience difficulties logging in. Ultimately, the agent clarified the process and provided additional codes, but the root cause appears to be a combination of system errors and miscommunication regarding the OTP process.",APP FUNCTIONALITY,85,APP - OTP,90,App - OTP,5999

439487,"user: Hello, I ordered via ZUS app (ID: 24070919506) and place a remark to place the items outside designated table outside the building. I was in a meeting when the Grab driver called. When I went down, the order was no where to be found. Grab driver said it's SOP to ensure item is passed or contact customer - this is the first time I heard if can't contact will return to branch. Usually Grab driver will inform via WhatsApp or anything and leave the item on table. I was infuriated cuz I was scolded by the Grab guy. Adding on the ZUS app shared a successful order and have to go through so many steps for customer service, aka inefficient use of time. Our team is hungry and my boss is frustrated there's no coffee. Note I'm very angry about ZUS's system. Please update me asap what can u do next. Re-delivering our orders is the best option.

user: Oh hi hadirah 👋
agent: Yes, espresso shot should be added to the Hot Jasmine Cham Latté.
user: I see, so then technically i got a jasmine milk tea instead of cham latte 😅
agent: We sincerely apologize for the incident. We will promptly escalate it to the outlet's person in charge (PIC) for thorough investigation and appropriate measures to prevent its recurrence.
agent: May we resend the correct drink to you?
user: Can I get a voucher instead? Or is there other ways?

Primary Concern: Received the wrong item in the order (Jasmine Cham Latte instead of expected drink)  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the contents of the Jasmine Cham Latte and the inclusion of espresso  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clarity in the product description or preparation process  
- Possible error in order fulfillment leading to the wrong item being sent  
Resolution Offered: Refund of RM11.90 credited to the customer's ZUS Balance  
Overall Summary: The customer raised a concern about receiving the wrong item in their order, specifically questioning the contents of the Jasmine Cham Latte and whether espresso was included. The agent confirmed that the espresso shot should be part of the drink, leading the customer to realize they received a Jasmine Milk Tea instead. The agent escalated the issue for further investigation and offered a refund, which the customer accepted. The interaction concluded positively with the customer expressing satisfaction with the resolution. The root cause appears to be a combination of miscommunication regarding the drink's ingredients and an error in order fulfillment.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,WRONG DRINK,85,Wrong Drink,5800

I had address my complain in Zus App . As a cat lover, it is quite disappointing to me. I kindly request that you look into this matter promptly.

",Feedback / Improvement,App - Loyalty Issue,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to extend the due date for their ZUS Elite membership to December.  
Identified Problem: System limitations prevent the extension of the due date for the membership.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication between the customer and the agent regarding the request.  
- The agent's inability to understand the customer's repeated requests, leading to confusion.  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that they could still accumulate cup counts by ordering through the ZUS app but could not extend the expiry date due to system limitations.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over their inability to extend the due date for their ZUS Elite membership, citing a lack of time and funds during the semester break. The agent was unable to comprehend the request initially, leading to repeated clarifications from the customer. Ultimately, the agent explained that due to system limitations, the due date could not be extended, but the customer could still accumulate cup counts through purchases. The interaction highlighted a communication gap and system constraints as the root causes of the issue.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,75,ZUS BALANCE WITHDRAWAL,40,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,5008

Primary Concern: Difficulty in placing an order for a bottled caffe latte with no sugar option  
Identified Problem: Lack of a no sugar option on the Food Panda platform for the customer's order  
Contributing Factors:  
- The preset options on Food Panda only allow for ""less sugar"" instead of ""no sugar.""  
- The customer is diabetic and requires a specific order modification that is not available in the app.  
Resolution Offered: The agent notified the outlet of the customer's request for no sugar in the order.  
Overall Summary: The customer reached out to the coffee chain's support to express difficulty in placing an order for a bottled caffe latte without sugar due to the limitations of the Food Panda app. The agent facilitated communication with the outlet to ensure the customer's request was noted. The primary issue stemmed from the lack of a no sugar option on the ordering platform, which could potentially affect customers with dietary restrictions.

Primary Concern: Extended waiting period for order delivery  
Identified Problem: Failure to assign a rider to the order in a timely manner  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error or inefficiency in rider assignment  
- Lack of clear communication regarding order status and cancellation policy  
Resolution Offered: Refund processed to the customer's ZUS Balance  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over an order that had been pending for over two hours without a rider being assigned. Despite the automated system stating that the order would be canceled if a rider was not found within 30 minutes, the order remained active. The agent eventually confirmed that a refund had been processed, but the prolonged wait and lack of communication contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction. The root cause appears to be a failure in the system to efficiently assign a rider and communicate effectively with the customer.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,SLOW RIDER ALLOCATION,90,Slow Rider Allocation,5984

I hope this email finds you well.

I am a dedicated fan of Zus Coffee and have very much enjoyed your drinks
without any issues. I recently ordered the new Dark Oolong Cham Coffee from
your menu. I loved the drink, it tasted amazing  as always.


However, I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning incident that
occured with my recent order.

Today, I have placed an order for a drink but I have received unsettling
text messages from a rider who had access to my personal number. Hence,
this has made me feel very uncomfortable.



This is a violation of my privacy and it should not happen to other Zus
customers as well.

I kindly request that you take appropriate action to this rider's behaviour
that such incidents shall not happen again in the future. I would
appreciate it if you could look into this matter and address it
accordingly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Overall Summary: The customer, Nur Izzah, experienced a double payment issue due to a notification error in the app that indicated a failed transaction. This led her to make a second payment, resulting in two charges. The agent acknowledged the issue, apologized for the inconvenience, and confirmed that a refund was being processed, which would take 7-14 working days. The root cause appears to be a combination of system errors and potential bank processing issues.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,90,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,90,Double Payment Charges,5308

Primary Concern: Missing crème on the Iced Velvet Crème Latté  
Identified Problem: Failure to include the crème topping in the order  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of proper quality control during order preparation  
- Absence of clear labeling on the packaging, leading to confusion  
Resolution Offered: Refund of RM13.90 to the customer's ZUS Balance  
Overall Summary: The customer reported that their Iced Velvet Crème Latté was missing the crème topping, which was a key component of the drink. The agent acknowledged the issue and offered a replacement, but since the customer could not collect it the same day, a refund was provided instead. The root cause appears to be a failure in quality control during the preparation of the order, compounded by inadequate labeling on the packaging. The customer expressed frustration with the service but ultimately accepted the refund.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,85,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,5738

",Order Info / Status,Missed Out - Remarks,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Repeated issue with drink orders being served with ice despite specifying ""no ice.""  
Identified Problem: Lack of a clear ""no ice"" option in the ordering system leading to miscommunication or errors in fulfilling the order.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Inconsistent adherence to customer specifications by the outlet.  
- Absence of a dedicated option for ""no ice"" in the ordering process, which could lead to confusion.  
Resolution Offered: A 20% voucher as a token of apology and assurance that the feedback will be forwarded to the relevant team for improvement.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a recurring issue where their drink orders were not prepared according to their specifications of ""no ice.""
