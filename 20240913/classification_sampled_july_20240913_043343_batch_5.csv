",Feedback / Improvement,App - OTP,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to receive OTP code for app login  
Identified Problem: The phone number provided by the customer was repeatedly flagged as invalid by the system.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer may have entered the phone number in an incorrect format or the system may not recognize the number as valid.  
- Potential miscommunication regarding the format required for the phone number (e.g., needing to include country code).  
Resolution Offered: The agent provided the OTP code after confirming the phone number, but the customer’s initial issue of not receiving the OTP was not fully resolved until the agent intervened.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving an OTP code necessary for app login. The main issue stemmed from the system rejecting the customer's valid phone number as invalid. Contributing factors included possible format miscommunication and system validation errors. The agent eventually provided the OTP, but the initial problem of receiving the OTP was a significant concern throughout the interaction.",APP FUNCTIONALITY,85,APP - OTP,90,App - OTP,4373

The root cause of the issue appears to be a lack of available riders, compounded by potential communication gaps regarding the order's status.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,SLOW RIDER ALLOCATION,85,Slow Rider Allocation,5019

Primary Concern: Incorrect drink received and delay in order preparation

Contributing Factors:  
- System or process errors leading to incorrect drink preparation  
- Possible miscommunication between staff and customers regarding order details

Overall Summary: The customer, Aimee, expressed frustration over receiving the wrong drink (oolong milk tea with espresso instead of the ordered milk tea) and noted that this was not the first occurrence of such an issue. Additionally, there was a significant delay in the preparation of her order, which took over half an hour. The agent acknowledged the mistake, offered to resend the correct drink, and assured Aimee that the issue would be addressed with the outlet to prevent future occurrences. The root cause appears to be a combination of operational errors in drink preparation and potential miscommunication within the service process.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,WRONG DRINK,85,Wrong Drink,6117

452471,"user: Dear Sir/Madam,I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received at Zus Coffee in Bukit Tinggi 2 klang, Malaysia on Sunday, July 28, 2024, at around 10 AM. I was attended by an Indian barista named Niverthaa Anparasu. During my visit, I found her demeanor to be unfriendly. She did not respond to my order, which made me unsure whether she had heard or acknowledged it. As a result, I had to repeat my order multiple times.I suggested to her that she should at least respond with an ""ok"" or ""yes"" to indicate that she had received my order and allow me to continue with my second and third orders. Unfortunately, she did not take my suggestion to heart and continued with the same level of service.A coffee shop experience is not just about the coffee; it is about the overall atmosphere and customer service. I have had positive experiences at other establishments such as Starbucks and HWC, where the staff are attentive and responsive. I hope that Zus Coffee can learn from these examples and improve its service standards.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing positive changes at your establishment.

The customer was informed that the refund could take up to 14 working days to process. The interaction concluded with the customer receiving confirmation that the refund would be credited to their Maybank account. The root cause appears to be a bank processing error or system glitch that led to the double charge.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,90,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,90,Double Payment Charges,5104

- The customer relied on the store staff's acknowledgment of the incident for validation.  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the customer could collect a replacement drink from the outlet on the same day.  
Overall Summary: The customer inquired about the eligibility for a replacement drink after it spilled in the store. The main issue stemmed from the customer's inability to provide photographic evidence of the incident, which could have facilitated a smoother resolution.

         I was at Zus Melaka on Monday. I ordered an americano with milk on the side and was appalled when I was told that it’s the company procedure not to serve milk with black coffee!!! This is the first coffee outlet which do not serve milk with coffee . Absurd!! Told the shop assistant - I will never go to another ZUS!!!

Primary Concern: Customer was denied milk on the side with their Americano due to company policy.  
Identified Problem: Company standard operating procedures do not allow serving milk on the side with black coffee.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of flexibility in company policies regarding beverage customization.  
- Customer's expectation based on previous experiences at other coffee outlets.  
Resolution Offered: Suggested trying the Iced Cafe Latte as an alternative.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being unable to receive milk on the side with their Americano, which they found absurd and contrary to their experiences at other coffee shops. The root cause of the issue stems from the company's standard operating procedures that restrict customization options for beverages. The agent offered an alternative drink but did not address the customer's dissatisfaction with the policy itself.",FEEDBACK / SUGGESTIONS,85,COMPLAINTS,85,Complaints,4387

Primary Concern: Received the wrong item (dairy instead of Oatside milk)

- Lack of proper communication regarding ingredient availability  
- Possible system or inventory management error leading to out-of-stock items  
Resolution Offered: Refund of RM30.90 to ZUS Balance

Primary Concern: Double payment charges for a transaction that did not reflect in the account.  
Identified Problem: System error or miscommunication leading to a failure in processing the second payment.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer attempted to make two payments, but only one was credited to their account.  
- The customer faced issues with the OTP (One-Time Password) process, which may have contributed to the confusion regarding the payments.

",Delivery,Rider Behavior,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery  
Identified Problem: The order was not delivered within a reasonable time frame, and the rider was unreachable.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was placed at 9:58 AM and not delivered by 11:24 AM, leading to a wait of almost 2 hours.  
- The rider was unreachable, preventing the customer from contacting them for updates.  
- The outlet experienced a water issue later, which affected the preparation of another order.  
Resolution Offered: A new rider was assigned to deliver the order, and a refund was issued for a subsequent order that could not be fulfilled due to the outlet's water issue.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced a significant delay in receiving their coffee order, which was compounded by the inability to contact the rider. After expressing their frustration, the agent assigned a new rider and later addressed a separate order cancellation due to a water issue at the outlet, offering a refund. The interaction concluded positively, with the customer expressing gratitude for the resolution. The root cause of the issue was primarily the delay in delivery and the rider's unavailability, along with operational challenges at the outlet.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,SLOW DELIVERY SERVICE,80,Slow Delivery Service,6043

I visited few days ago, ordered hot americano, was told tat they dun provide creamer, so I asked for some milk for me to mix it in myself, was told tat due to sop they cant provide milk for me. End up I hv to order latte instead of my fav americano. I understand most ppl drink black Americano, but I think it would be better if u can provide either creamer or milk for ppl like me who drink Americano with a bit of milk n sugar. This is individual preference, hope u can consider to provide creamer/milk in future. Tks

user: Tapi this morning i tgok dh downgrade ke rising star..last night i 7/8 cup dkt super addict..bukan ke if i purchase 1 cup before 1 july smlm i akan di upgrade ke zus elite?
agent: Please refer to the downgraded - quarter section.
user: Ye sy faham
user: Before i purchase semalam dkt my apps dah tulis macam ni “collect 1 more cup by 30jun to become zus ellite ”..then smlm i purchase on 30jun 9.39pm
user: Mengikut kefahaman sy..if i beli coffee 1 cup smlm i akan jadi zus ellite
agent: You have become a super addict, you didn't collect enough cups. That's why you have been downgraded to a rising star.
user: Which part yg i xcukup cups tu?
agent: You only purchase 2 drinks that have not used any voucher.
agent: Any voucher code or promotional/combo item utilizes while purchasing any beverages from the ZUS App, please note the cup count will not be counted in your account. Beverages purchased without any discount/voucher code will be eligible for the cup counts and ZUS point(s) will be added to your ZUS account for every purchase.

agent: 24041132788, 24041132952 and 24060353670 - all 3 orders when you became a super addict, you were using the vouchers. The cup count won't be collected.
agent: The message stated you have to collect 8 cups before 30 June, which means that you need to purchase 8 cups without using any vouchers. If you don't use any vouchers, the cup count will be counted.
agent: Since you didn't collect enough cups and today is the 1st of July, a new quarter, your level has been downgraded once again.
agent: Hope the explanation clarifies you and we are sorry for any inconvenience. 

agent: Is there anything else we could assist you with?
user: Then how about my points last night?
user: 
From this ss zus tempat i beli semalam dia approved my order on 1 july..adakah sebab ni i xdapat points 2x and downgrade?


user: Super addict rm1=2 points right?
user: This is unfair..i sanggup keluar malam semalam sbb nak purchase coffee sbb dkt apps i dh tulis “collect 1 more cup by 30jun to become zus ellite”..masa tu i dh tulis dkt apps 7/8..then i faham kalau i purchase 1 more cup cukup la jd 8/8..then akan upgrade..points ni pun dikira bila dh 1 july..points dikira rm1=1.5 points sedangkan i purchase masa i tgh super addict
