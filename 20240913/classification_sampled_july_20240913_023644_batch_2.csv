Primary Concern: Order not received despite being marked as delivered

- The delivery driver did not contact the customer as requested.  
- The customer was unable to reach the driver after realizing the order was marked as delivered.

Overall Summary: The customer, Michele, expressed frustration over not receiving her order of an Iced White Peach Oolong Cham Latté, which was marked as delivered. Despite providing the correct address and leaving notes for the driver, there was no communication from the delivery person. The agent confirmed the order was marked as delivered but could not provide further assistance until the customer calmed down. Eventually, a refund was issued, but the customer remained dissatisfied with the service and the delay in resolution.

The agent acknowledged the complaint and offered a voucher as compensation, but the customer was not satisfied with this resolution, emphasizing that they did not need vouchers and were disappointed with the consistency of the product quality.

user: Why my ZusApp membership when i check in the morning it is Addict , then by night it became Elite, is this a flaw?
agent: Hi Michael, one moment while I check on this please.
user: I didnt print screen but i found out when i order my drink this morning
agent: Hi Michael, upon checking, your membership has been downgraded because you did not accumulate enough cups (8) during the previous quarter. You managed to collect only 6 cup counts and therefore the membership status falls to Super Addict upon entering this new quarter.
agent: 
You may refer to this FAQ for more information:



user: But now im elite, strange
agent: You were ZUS Elite before this, and today it was downgraded to Super Addict. Is it showing as Super addict or ZUS Elite on your app?
user: 
user: Elite
user: So that is why is strange
agent: May I have a snapshot of your 'Home' page please?
user: 
agent: Thank you for the reference.
agent: I shall check with our tech team on this as it may have been a technical error on our end.
user: Yup
user: That is what i thought
agent: Meanwhile, the status shall not affect your purchase. You may refresh your app a few times tomorrow as the status was just downgraded yesterday.
user: So im your daily user so my concern will be points
agent: Thank you for highlighting the matter to us.
agent: In this case, your points and cup count will not be affected. The issue only concerns the tier title at the moment 😊
user: Points will be affected cos if addict is x2, elite is x3
user: So it is quite a big difference
agent: You are correct, the points computation will be affected for your future orders. The exisiting points will remain as it is.
agent: I have raised the issue to our tech team and kindly be advised that it may take within 24-48 hours for resolution.
user: Ok thank u Anis
agent: Kindly reach out to us should you still have issues after the recommended resolution time.
agent: It is my pleasure, Michael!
agent: Apart from this, is there anything else that I can help you with on this chat?
user: Nope. Thanks and good night
agent: You are most welcome.

Primary Concern: Sudden change in ZusApp membership status from Addict to Elite  
Identified Problem: Possible technical error or miscommunication regarding membership tier status  
Contributing Factors:  
- Membership tier status not updating correctly in the app  
- Customer's misunderstanding of the membership criteria and point system  
Resolution Offered: Agent raised the issue with the tech team and advised the customer to refresh the app; resolution expected within 24-48 hours.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed confusion over a sudden change in their ZusApp membership status, which appeared to fluctuate between tiers. The agent identified that the membership had been downgraded due to insufficient cup accumulation but acknowledged the customer's current status as Elite. The agent raised the issue with the tech team, suggesting it may be a technical error, and assured the customer that their points would not be affected, although future point accumulation would differ based on the tier. The root cause appears to be a technical error in the app's membership status display.",LOYALTY AND REWARDS,85,APP - LOYALTY ISSUE,85,App - Loyalty Issue,4197

- The agent's follow-up message indicates a lack of response from the customer, which may have contributed to the chat being closed prematurely.  
Resolution Offered: The agent expressed a willingness to assist and resolve the issue but did not provide a specific solution due to the lack of information from the customer.  
Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer reporting a spillage in their order, expressing frustration. The agent acknowledged the issue and sought clarification on the affected drink but did not receive a response from the customer. This lack of communication led to the chat being closed without a resolution. The root cause appears to be the customer's initial lack of detail regarding the spillage, which hindered the agent's ability to assist effectively.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,75,SPILLAGE,80,Spillage,4036

Primary Concern: Missing item from the order (Matcha Strawberry Latté)  
Identified Problem: System issues leading to a lack of synchronization with the outlet system, causing delays and miscommunication regarding the order.  
Contributing Factors:  
- High volume of customer inquiries leading to delayed responses.  
- Ongoing technical issues affecting order processing and fulfillment.  
Resolution Offered: A 20% discount voucher for the next purchase, but no free delivery coupon could be provided.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a missing item from their order, specifically a Matcha Strawberry Latté. The agent initially offered a refund, which the customer rejected, insisting on a replacement instead to avoid additional delivery charges. Due to ongoing technical issues, the agent was unable to guarantee a timely replacement before the customer's specified time. Ultimately, a 20% discount voucher was offered as compensation, but the customer felt that the resolution was inadequate given the circumstances. The root cause of the issue stemmed from system errors and high inquiry volumes, leading to miscommunication and delays in service.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,OOS,80,OOS,15574

",Delivery,Failed Delivery,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Order not received in a timely manner  
Identified Problem: Delay in order delivery and lack of communication from the rider  
Contributing Factors:  
- The rider was unreachable and did not respond to the customer's calls.  
- The customer was unable to change the delivery location after the order was confirmed.  
Resolution Offered: A recovery order was arranged to be delivered to the new location, or a refund was offered.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced significant delays in receiving their order, which was compounded by the rider's lack of communication. Despite the agent's attempts to assist, the customer was frustrated by the inability to change the delivery location and the overall service experience. A recovery order was eventually arranged, but the initial issues stemmed from the rider's unavailability and the company's policy on order amendments.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,CUSTOMER UNREACHABLE / UNAVAILABLE,85,Customer Unreachable / Unavailable,8211

agent: There is a large pH difference between plant-based milks – soy ranges around seven to eight – and coffee, which differs from shot to shot and bean to bean usually is about 4.5. The proteins in soy milk are sensitive to the lower pH of the coffee shot which is why the proteins can 'denature' and look curdled.

",Feedback / Improvement,App - OTP,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to receive OTP codes for app access  
Identified Problem: The customer was unable to receive OTP codes due to issues with the phone numbers provided, which were repeatedly flagged as invalid by the system.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer provided multiple phone numbers, but the system did not recognize any of them as valid.  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the format of the phone numbers required for OTP verification.  
Resolution Offered: The agent eventually provided a valid OTP code after confirming the correct phone number with the customer.

",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Drink,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Quality of the drink received (sour milk)  
Identified Problem: Poor quality control of the beverage served  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication between the customer and the agent regarding the issue  
- Inadequate response to the customer's request for a refund or replacement  
Resolution Offered: The agent suggested contacting within 8 hours for complaints and requested images of the issue, but did not directly address the refund or replacement request.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of their drink, specifically mentioning that the milk was sour. The agent struggled to understand the customer's requests and failed to provide a satisfactory resolution regarding a refund or replacement. The root cause appears to be a combination of poor quality control in the product and ineffective communication during the customer service interaction.",PRODUCT QUALITY / HYGIENE ISSUE,85,QUALITY COMPLAINT - DRINK,85,Quality Complaint - Drink,5101

",Feedback / Improvement,Complaints,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Double payment charges and order cancellation due to rider unavailability  
Identified Problem: System errors leading to double payment and rider assignment issues  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of rider availability at the time of order  
- Miscommunication regarding order status and cancellation process  
Resolution Offered: Refund processed to ZUS balance for the double payment charge; order cancellation confirmed  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced issues with double payment charges and wanted to cancel their order due to unavailability of a rider.

After some back-and-forth regarding order ID verification and cancellation requests, the order was ultimately canceled, and the refund was confirmed.

Hello Zus Team.I ordered a 1.0L Cafe Latte, Almond Milk with no sugar & LYDIA beans, from the Curve outlet for Takeaway. It had a weird taste like burnt plastic in it. I had been ordering this exact order both in cup and bottled once before, with the same type of milk and beans and had never encountered that kind of taste. However, today's coffee is different. I understand that they maybe are rushing since its almost closing time, but quality is important too. I didn't get to drink all of the coffee I just poured into my ceramic glass at home. I am seeking for advices and resolutions on this issue, Zus team as I had been a regular Zussies since an outlet opened at Parit Raja, Johor. I tasted the coffee and I loved it, that is why I continue to support Zus. I am asking for dearest attention for your team to look and resolve this issues as soon as possible.

​​​​​​​​​​​​Hi Agnes,     Greetings from ZUS Coffee!   I'm writing to follow up with you regarding your order at ZUS Coffee The Curve outlet on July 2nd, 2024.   We reached out to you on the 4th of July, 2024 requesting your current phone number so that the District Manager of ZUS Coffee The Curve can contact you. However, we have not yet received a response from you.

Primary Concern: The customer received a Cafe Latte that tasted like burnt plastic.  
Identified Problem: Possible quality control issues at the outlet, especially during closing time.  
Contributing Factors:

",Payment,Payment Error / Failure,Payment Gateway,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Double payment charges and confusion over transaction receipts  
Identified Problem: A failed transaction that was not communicated clearly to the customer

438682,"user: Hello there, I'm at your Taipan outlet right now and I'm extremely displeased with the entire experience here. I wanted to get Zus Lemonade with a Boss shot in it and no sugar, but the baristas kept insisting on getting the Thunder (Which has honey in it). Despite insisting on a Lemonade with coffee, they keep insisting they'd make a Thunder cause it's the same thing. It definitely is not, the honey is way too sweet, and there's a reason there's a difference between the Zus Lemonade and the Honey Lemon on the menu. I went back to the counter to ask, and they said the normal lemonade has honey in it already cause it's standard procedure. I just had my Zus Lemonade with coffee in it and no added sugar at the Starling mall just a couple of days ago and it was great. What on earth is the 8 people working at the Taipan outlet doing??
user: The coffee is disgustingly sweet, and I have to pay money for the barista to not give me what I want and insist on making it another way??
agent: Hi this is Nuraini, please give me a moment to carefully review your selected options and I'll get back to you soon. Your patience is appreciated!

agent: Please give me a moment to check on this matter.
agent: Thank you for waiting.
agent: We understand how unpleasant this experience must have been for you and we would like to apologize for this.
agent: May we get a receipt and a picture of the drink for us to assist further?
user: 
user: Here you go, I'm still sitting here, extremely angry and disgusted by the drink. and the fact that we spent so long going back and forth with the barista about how it's not the same when we were ordering. but they kept pushing that the Thunder is the same thing and that they all have honey in it
user: Thank you for looking into this
user: We also told them to not put sugar in it, but they gave us regular sugar
user: my friend ordered a coconut coffee with less sugar, but they keyed in and even wrote on his cup to put in extra sugar
user: the team behind the counter just keeps chit chatting and laughing, at least they should do their jobs correctly but instead they're doing the exact opposite
agent: Thank you for the receipt.

Primary Concern: Invalid phone number preventing refund processing  
Identified Problem: The customer's phone number is not recognized as registered in the ZUS Coffee system.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer was informed that the Watermelon Berry Refresher was out of stock, leading to a refund request.  
- The customer repeatedly provided the same phone number, which the system did not accept as valid.  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the refund had been processed to the customer's ZUS Balance and advised checking the app.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced an issue with an out-of-stock item, leading to a refund request. However, the main issue arose when the customer attempted to confirm the refund, only to be met with repeated invalid phone number notifications. This indicates a potential system error or miscommunication regarding the registration of the customer's phone number, contributing to the customer's frustration. The agent did offer a resolution by confirming the refund had been processed, but the ongoing phone number issue remained unresolved during the interaction.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,85,ZUS BALANCE WITHDRAWAL,75,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,7901

",Delivery,Slow Delivery Service,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to an incorrect order/outlet issue.  
Identified Problem: The system's inability to cancel the order once a rider is assigned, despite the rider not being assigned at the time of the customer's request.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer was informed that the order was not yet being prepared due to no rider being assigned initially, leading to confusion.  
- Miscommunication regarding the status of the order and the rider assignment process.  
Resolution Offered: The agent stated that the system would automatically refund the order if a rider could not be found within 30 minutes, but did not facilitate the cancellation directly.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over wanting to cancel an order due to it being incorrect. The main issue stemmed from the system's policy that prevents cancellations once a rider is assigned, despite the customer being told that no rider was assigned at the time of their request. This led to confusion and dissatisfaction with the service. The agent provided information about the rider but did not resolve the cancellation request directly.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,80,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,5181

agent: Hi this is Pavitra, please give me a moment to carefully review your selected options and I'll get back to you soon. Your patience is appreciated!

user: is it normal for your drinks to come in half the glass when you request for less ice? This is unacceptable. This is not the first time I’ve been disappointed by the service of your staff at taman bukit anggerik. There is supposed to be coconut milk in this drink and even that is not added to the drink!
agent: Hi Rishanth Daniel, we're currently handling multiple inquiries. Please bear with us as we prioritise and attend to yours as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.

user: this is already the 2nd time I’ve had bad service for your staff at this location. They need more training in regards to the drink and customer service! Extremely dissatisfied!
agent: May I confirm if you have requested for 5 ice cubes only for the drink?

user: and I am telling you that it was not. I just said it tasted different compared to the ones at your other outlets. I did not receive the drink I wanted because there was supposed to be coconut milk. I do not taste any coconut milk at all.
user: I would like a full refund. This is not what I ordered. You did not even answer my questions.
agent: We apologize for any inconvenience. Please note that the drink may not have a full coconut milk flavor due to the addition of Niko Neko Matcha and Roasted Hazelnut syrup, resulting in a lighter coconut milk taste for the drink.

agent: 

agent: You may refer to image below for further clarifications.

agent: Hope this clarifies. Apart from this, Is there anything else we could assist you with?

user: You don’t seem to understand what I am telling you. I have tasted this drink before. It does not taste the same this time. I do not taste any coconut milk compared to the last time. I am telling you that the baristas did not follow the recipe given by HQ!
agent: We are putting the highest priority on this issue and will forward it to the relevant team to check and take necessary action. May I confirm will you be able to visit the same outlet once again?

user: Yes I will be able to visit but until your staff have been trained properly on both being a barista and having decent customer service I do not want to return to this store.
user: I want a full refund of my order
user: I am extremely unhappy with how you have replied as well. Where is the solution to this issue? What will you do to rectify this issue?
agent: Please hold on while we check further on this issue.

user: I asked a question earlier on how come the glass is only half full when the customer expects a full glass of the drink ordered and still unanswered. If you yourself saw this drink in the picture shown would you have accepted it happily?
agent: Thank you for waiting.

Primary Concern: The Zus app is slow and lagging.  
Identified Problem: Potential technical issues with the Zus app, possibly due to bugs or performance problems.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer's experience with other apps (e.g., Facebook Messenger) functioning properly, indicating the issue may be isolated to the Zus app.

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration with the slow performance of the Zus app, noting that other applications were functioning well.

Primary Concern: Item ordered is out of stock  
Identified Problem: Lack of inventory management leading to unavailability of ordered items  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer received a call from the store informing them of the stock issue, indicating a communication breakdown between the store and the online ordering system.  
- The chat agent struggled to understand the customer's requests, leading to confusion and delays in addressing the issue.  
Resolution Offered: Refund processed to the customer's ZUS balance for the unavailable items.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over an item being out of stock after placing an order. The root cause appears to be a lack of effective inventory management, as the customer was informed by the store about the stock issue. Additionally, the chat agent's difficulty in understanding the customer's requests contributed to a prolonged interaction. Ultimately, the customer was offered a refund, which was accepted, and the chat concluded with the agent's offer for further assistance.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,80,OOS,90,OOS,5359

Primary Concern: Invalid phone number registration and inadequate drink quantity  
Identified Problem: The customer's phone number is not recognized in the system, and the drink received was not filled to the expected level.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The phone number format may not align with the system's requirements, leading to registration issues.  
- The preparation of the drink resulted in less liquid than expected, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the product specifications or quality control issues at the outlet.

Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer, Sofea, who faced issues with her phone number not being recognized and receiving a drink that was less than expected in quantity. The agent acknowledged the concerns and offered a refund, but the customer expressed frustration and declined the offer.

We cant even see who is the rider,nor check where he delivers.like today

Primary Concern: Incorrect drink order and poor service experience

Primary Concern: Double payment deduction from the customer's bank account  
Identified Problem: The customer experienced a double deduction for a single order, leading to confusion and frustration.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer initially attempted to pay with one bank account and then used another, which may have caused confusion regarding the transaction status.  
- The agent's system only showed one transaction captured, which may indicate a potential system error or miscommunication regarding the payment processing.  
Resolution Offered: The agent assured the customer that the floating amount would be refunded within 14 working days, pending verification of the double deduction.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Aisyah, contacted support regarding a double payment for her order (ID: 24071737875). After some back and forth, the agent confirmed that only one transaction was recorded on their end, but assured Aisyah that any excess charge would be refunded within 14 working days.

agent: Greetings from ZUS Coffee. We sincerely apologise on the delay on attending to your inquiry as our support team currently experiencing an overwhelmed volume of chat.

agent: 
Based on the provided image, we notice the drink has been added with a thicker foam at the preparation stage which has dissipated during the delivery. 

You will not receive a full cup. However, the liquid will be deducted at least an average of 2cm from the mouth of the cup. We'll highlight this to the relevant outlet for further improvement. 

agent: May we proceed with refund to your ZUS Balance for immediate refund?
agent: Kindly reopen this chat if you need further assistance from our end. We will assist you as soon as we can. I'll be ending the chat here today. Thank you and have a good day!",Outlet,Foam Issue,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incomplete latte order due to spillage  
Identified Problem: The drink was not filled to the expected level, attributed to foam dissipation during delivery.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The preparation process resulted in excessive foam that reduced the liquid volume during delivery.  
- Communication issues between the customer and the agent, leading to delays in addressing the concern.  
Resolution Offered: A refund to the customer's ZUS Balance was proposed.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving a latte that was less than half full, which was attributed to spillage and foam dissipation during delivery. The agent acknowledged the issue and offered a refund to the customer's balance, while also indicating that the matter would be addressed with the relevant outlet for improvement. Communication challenges contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction during the interaction.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,FOAM ISSUE,85,Foam Issue,5579

We sincerely apologized on this matter. Based on the provided image, we notice the drink has been added with a thicker foam at the preparation stage which has dissipated during the delivery. 

You will not receive a full cup. However, the liquid will be deducted at least an average of 2cm from the mouth of the cup. We'll highlight this to the relevant outlet for further improvement.

Mocha and it was not ready for pick up when I arrived which is very
unusual. The barista got it ready but when I drank it in my car, it was
actually hot chocolate. I often order cafe mocha so I know exactly when it
is not.

I'm sharing here the screen shot of my order and the cup that I got. No
label on the cup to indicate the order and the colour of the drink is
definitely not cafe mocha.

Please advice whether I need to request for a refund or get the correct
order later.
