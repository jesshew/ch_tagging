Zus Coffee


Dear Sir/Madam,


I am writing to formally complain about the unacceptable behavior of the manager at your Mersing branch. On 16th July 2024 , I visited the Zus Coffee store in Mersing and encountered an issue that significantly impacted my experience.


The store was very busy and all the tables were occupied. However, I noticed that the manager was occupying a table for their personal work. When I politely asked if we could use the table, the manager refused without providing a reasonable explanation.


As a paying customer, I believe that the comfort and accommodation of patrons should be a priority, especially in a busy café setting. It was quite disappointing to see that the manager did not exhibit the expected level of professionalism and customer service.


I hope that you will address this issue promptly and ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. I am a regular customer at Zus Coffee and have always enjoyed the atmosphere and service, which makes this experience particularly disheartening.


Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.

Primary Concern: Received expired food item from an order placed through Grab  
Identified Problem: Lack of accountability and response from both ZUS Coffee and Grab regarding the expired food item

- Miscommunication between the customer, ZUS Coffee, and Grab regarding responsibility for the expired food

",Feedback / Improvement,App - OTP,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Difficulty updating phone number  
Identified Problem: System misunderstanding or miscommunication in the chat interface  
Contributing Factors:  
- Repeated prompts for language selection and mobile number without addressing the customer's request  
- Confusion caused by the automated responses leading to a limit on retries  
Resolution Offered: Phone number successfully updated after connecting with a live agent  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced frustration due to an inability to update their phone number through the automated chat system, which repeatedly failed to understand their request. This was compounded by a limit on retries, leading to further confusion. After being connected to a live agent, the customer was able to provide their new phone number, which was successfully updated. The root cause of the issue appears to be a miscommunication within the automated system, which did not effectively handle the customer's request.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,85,CHANGE / UPDATE INFO,85,Change / Update Info,4504
