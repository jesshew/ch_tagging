agent: Hi Sakinah, good morning.
user: Morning amirah
agent: Thank you for the picture and we are sorry you are unable to taste the coffee in your Iced Buttercrème Latté.
agent: Please be informed that the drink contains a little amount of caffeine only.
agent: If you want a strong coffee flavour, you have to add shot for the drink.
user: Please be consistent then

agent: Thank you for letting us know.
agent: We already raised this issue to the outlet. The outlet manager will further investigate your complaint and necessary action will be taken to prevent the same incident from happening again.

Primary Concern: Missing coffee shot in the Buttercream Latte  
Identified Problem: Inconsistency in product preparation leading to a lack of coffee flavor  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication regarding the drink's caffeine content and preparation  
- Possible changes in the recipe or preparation method at the outlet  
Resolution Offered: Refund of RM10.90 credited to ZUS Balance and assurance of investigation into the issue  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving a Buttercream Latte without the expected coffee flavor, noting that a previous order had been satisfactory. The agent explained that the drink contains only a small amount of caffeine and that a coffee shot must be added for a stronger flavor. The issue was escalated to the outlet manager for further investigation, and a refund was issued to the customer. The root cause appears to be inconsistency in product preparation and communication regarding the drink's characteristics.",PRODUCT QUALITY / HYGIENE ISSUE,75,QUALITY COMPLAINT - DRINK,85,Quality Complaint - Drink,4877

Primary Concern: Missing Matcha Macam Sticker Pack from the order  
Identified Problem: The sticker pack was not included in the delivered order, leading to confusion about the delivery status.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the delivery address (customer's house number was incorrect in the system).  
- Possible oversight in order fulfillment, resulting in the sticker pack being omitted.  
Resolution Offered: Refund of the amount for the missing sticker pack to the customer's ZUS Balance.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially reported a missing Matcha Macam Sticker Pack from their order. After confirming the order details, it was found that the order was marked as delivered, but the customer had not received the item due to an incorrect address in the system. The agent offered a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance as a resolution. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of miscommunication regarding the delivery address and a potential oversight in the order fulfillment process.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,80,OOS,75,OOS,5438

I bought one cup of coffee amounting to RM10.30 on 28 June 2024. I paid
using Apple Pay, and the app said the first transaction did not go through
(the status showed ""to pay"" even after refreshing the app and waiting for
several minutes). I then proceeded to pay a second time for the same order
ID, and it went through.

However, after checking my credit card statement, I noticed I was charged
twice. The receipt from ZUS (Fiuu) also showed that I was charged twice for
the same order number.

Please assist and help to refund the extra charge. I have attached both

",Customer Account Details,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Refund process after order cancellation  
Identified Problem: Auto-cancellation of the order due to unavailability of riders, leading to a refund to the ZUS wallet instead of the customer's bank account.  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error or policy that automatically refunds to ZUS wallet rather than bank account.  
- Lack of communication regarding the refund process and options available to the customer.  
Resolution Offered: The agent submitted a request for the refund to the customer's bank account, which will take 14 working days to process.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced frustration due to an order cancellation caused by the unavailability of riders, resulting in a refund to their ZUS wallet instead of their bank account. The customer expressed dissatisfaction with this policy, feeling it forced them to use the wallet again. The agent facilitated a refund request to the bank, which will take time to process, but the underlying issue appears to be a system policy that does not allow for direct bank refunds in such situations.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,INCORRECT REFUND AMOUNT / CHANNEL,85,Incorrect Refund Amount / Channel,5777

The interaction revealed issues with order preparation and communication, as the customer had to repeat her concerns multiple times due to the agent's inability to understand her requests. After several attempts to resolve the issue, the agent offered a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance, which was accepted. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of order fulfillment errors and inadequate communication during the customer service interaction.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,WRONG ORDER / ITEM(S),85,Wrong Order / Item(s),7299

",Delivery,Rider Behavior,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Extended waiting period for order preparation  
Identified Problem: Lack of rider assignment leading to order delay

- System failure to assign a rider in a timely manner  
- Possible high demand or low availability of riders at the time of order

I would like express my dissatisfaction on how my case was handle.
This is my order ID: 24071637046. I reach out to your Customer Service
team immediately as soon as I realised that my delivery consist of
wrong item. What I expect was of course the most direct compensation
which is refund on the wrong item.
I ordered 4 drinks ( 1x Hot Cafe Latte, 1x Zirty Matcha Latte, 1x
Double Choc Chip Frappe & 1x Americano Bottle 1 Litre). I received the
paper bag with my name written on the bag and the paper bag was
stapled and sealed(Good Condition) so definitely would highlight this
issue has nothing to do with the driver, I believe it was a mistake
that the shop made while packing the order as upon opening my bag I
realise immediately 1 of the items is wrong because there was no
bottle inside obviously and I receive another cup of beverage which
wasn’t labelled and not something I ordered and the rest of the 3
drinks received were all correct except for that 1 drink. But after
reaching out to your team, i didn’t get any prompt response so I
assume that your Customer Service team is not real time as I’ve sent
multiple explanations and supporting images of the case which I
encountered. After waiting for around 10minutes, I left the app as it
wasnt responsive and no notifications received ( The App is not user
friendly , not easy to navigate around and no notifications or updates
on my chat) but I left my email there mentioning to update me if there
is any decision made. After few hours I came back to the app to check
again to see if there was any updates. I checked and realised I’ve
gotten responses and I was missed out on that and it mentioned that
they offer to deliver my missing order. However, I wasn’t online that
time when your team has responded. I’m unsatisfied on how my case was
close after that as I actually waited and also left my contact details
in case your team have came up with a solution for my case. But , in
the end it’s just close like that. I actually paid for the drinks but
I did not get what I paid for. I felt that my case wasn’t handle in a
proper manner. Therefore, I writing this email to demand on a refund
of the incorrect item I did not received which is Americano 1 Litre
Bottle. I hope to hear prompt response from your team. If require any
supporting attachments, feel free to reach back to me. Appreciate your
time in handling my matter. Thank You.

user: Then ask to top up some milk, they refused. Said SOP not allowed
user: If Zus coffee continue doing this thing, I will consider not drink Zus Coffee in future.
user: Then tell me Zus coffee tumbler is bigger than their cup, the tumbler also original from Zus coffee, how I know the tumbler size is bigger than original cup?

user: Check with outlet they tell you SOP again
user: 
user: Already chosen tumbler option but still put in Cup
user: Then this is SOP?
user: Then just ask add little bit more milk for me as my drinks is double shot, said cannot because my tumbler is bigger which is not follow SOP
user: But the tumbler was bought from.Zus Coffee
user: Even remarks I also written please give me more milk for my drinks
user: If Zus Coffee only train outlet to follow SOP without follow customer request, then why want to design a bigger size tumbler for us to purchase?
user: Some more I didn't ask for put in cup, I ask to put in tumbler and add little bit of milk in my drinks only
user: Telling me add milk need money, the drinks already cost RM12.90, add little bit milk is very expensive? Funny answer I got.
agent: As per our check with the outlet, your Zirty Latte was prepared according to our standard operating procedures.

agent: In this case, may we offer a 20% discount voucher for you?

user: The tumbler was bought from Zus Coffee?
agent: We truly appreciate your kind understanding on this matter.

user: Then this question should ask Zus coffee
user: Why tumbler want to make different size?
user: Then customer not allow to request a little bit more milk for double shot drinks?
user: And I choose tumbler option, why want to prepare in cup?
user: Pouring here and there then split out count customer fault?
user: I think 20% discount is too less to solve this issue.
user: This makes me really angry from the outlet response
agent: The barista prepared the drink in the standard cup to measure the serving size accurately before pouring it into your tumbler.

user: This is not my fault, first tumbler is not me design, second the SOP set too strict, third the outlet didn't follow instruction to prepare in tumbler
user: OK, so I have to pour the drinks into the tumbler myself, if split out is my problem?
user: Do you think this is fair for me?

user: Then request to add back a bit milk only, is it too over?

user: Tumbler is mean to save plastic cup, but what I see is wasting plastic cup, then some more customer have to move it to tumbler, waste coffee when spill out.

user: Ordered in tumbler, but the shop put in cup, then when I tried to moved the drinks from cup to tumbler, it spill out. Then shop tell me this is their SOP
user: Then ask to top up some milk, they refused. Said SOP not allowed
user: If Zus coffee continue doing this thing, I will consider not drink Zus Coffee in future.
user: Then tell me Zus coffee tumbler is bigger than their cup, the tumbler also original from Zus coffee, how I know the tumbler size is bigger than original cup?
user: Telling me all the nonsense from the shop worker
user: I ordered I tumbler, but get in cup. Then when moving from cup to tumbler sure spill out
agent: Hi TAN GHEE KHON, we're currently handling multiple inquiries. Please bear with us as we prioritise and attend to yours as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.
user: This kind of knowledge also don't know? So funny...
user: Please look into my issue seriously, I am very angry now.
agent: We apologies for the inconvenience caused.
agent: Kindly let me check this with the outlet and will get back to you as soon as possible.

user: Check with outlet they tell you SOP again
user: 
user: Already chosen tumbler option but still put in Cup
user: Then this is SOP?
user: Then just ask add little bit more milk for me as my drinks is double shot, said cannot because my tumbler is bigger which is not follow SOP
user: But the tumbler was bought from.Zus Coffee
user: Even remarks I also written please give me more milk for my drinks
user: If Zus Coffee only train outlet to follow SOP without follow customer request, then why want to design a bigger size tumbler for us to purchase?
user: Some more I didn't ask for put in cup, I ask to put in tumbler and add little bit of milk in my drinks only
user: Telling me add milk need money, the drinks already cost RM12.90, add little bit milk is very expensive? Funny answer I got.
agent: As per our check with the outlet, your Zirty Latte was prepared according to our standard operating procedures. Please note that the standard cup size for a Zirty Latte is 16oz, while your tumbler is 20oz. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and the unpleasant experience you encountered.
agent: In this case, may we offer a 20% discount voucher for you?
user: The tumbler was bought from Zus Coffee?
agent: We truly appreciate your kind understanding on this matter.
user: Then this question should ask Zus coffee
user: Why tumbler want to make different size?
user: Then customer not allow to request a little bit more milk for double shot drinks?
user: And I choose tumbler option, why want to prepare in cup?
user: Pouring here and there then split out count customer fault?
user: I think 20% discount is too less to solve this issue.
user: This makes me really angry from the outlet response
agent: The barista prepared the drink in the standard cup to measure the serving size accurately before pouring it into your tumbler.
user: This is not my fault, first tumbler is not me design, second the SOP set too strict, third the outlet didn't follow instruction to prepare in tumbler
user: OK, so I have to pour the drinks into the tumbler myself, if split out is my problem?
user: Do you think this is fair for me?
user: During the drinks move to tumbler, the coffee split out a lot.
user: Then request to add back a bit milk only, is it too over?
user: I believe all outlet should have the measuring cup to prepare the drinks right? No necessary to prepare in the plastic cup and waste for the cup, then customer have to pour back to tumbler. Don't you think all these are extra works?

Primary Concern: Incorrect drink preparation leading to spillage  
Identified Problem: The outlet did not follow the customer's request to prepare the drink in a tumbler, instead using a cup, which caused spillage when transferring the drink.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) at the outlet that do not accommodate customer requests for specific drink preparations.  
- Lack of communication and training regarding the use of tumblers versus cups, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction.  
Resolution Offered: A FREE1CUP voucher and a 20% discount voucher were offered as compensation for the inconvenience.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving their drinks in a cup instead of a tumbler, leading to spillage when transferring the drinks. The outlet's strict adherence to SOPs prevented them from accommodating the customer's request for additional milk and proper drink preparation. The agent acknowledged the issue and offered compensation, but the customer emphasized the need for improved communication and training at the outlet to prevent future occurrences.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,85,SPILLAGE,85,Spillage,7267

Then carry the garbage near the outside with measles with a disrespectful facial reaction of anger! Do rough work like slamming things.I know you want to close so on! But where are your manners?! If you want to close, tell the customer that it's nice to see you next time, we'll tell you that you want to close!!! This is picking up our plate in an angry and not good way to show anger!? My luck is not yours. !!! Fire that man if you can! Zus take action! Please

         Perangai staff : out of service (terutama lelaki yang closing )

Pergi zus icity sebab nak lepak went there 8.40pm something until 9.30pm something.

Ada one of the staff keluar dari bilik staff room if not mistaken,saya dengan boss and another staff  tengah minum sambil borak dgn my boss tetiba dia kutip sampah dari tong besi sampah tu tetiba dngr benda kuat terjatuh which is penutup tong sampah. At first ingatkan terjatuh, rupanya sengaja dijatuhkan untuk menunjukkan tanda protes dekat kami!! Kemudian angkut sampah dekat luar dengan campak dengan reaksi wajah kurang sopan tanda marah! Buat kerja dengan kasar seperti menghempas barang. 

Saya tahu anda nak closing so on ! Tapi mana adab kau ya?! Kalau nak closing bagitahu customer elok elok jumpa depan kami beritahu nak closing !!! Ini kutip pinggan kami dengan cara marah dan tak elok tanda marah !? Nasib aku tak hamuk kat kau je. !!! Pecat laki tu kalau boleh ! Zus amik tindakan ! Please

Identified Problem: The customer is unable to cancel the order because the order ID is not being recognized by the agent.

Thank you and have a nice day! 😊",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Drink,Product,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: The customer received a drink that was only half full.  
Identified Problem: The drink's buttercream topping dissipated due to high temperature, leading to a perceived lack of drink volume.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the expected drink volume and presentation.  
- Potential quality control issue with the preparation of the drink.  
Resolution Offered: A RM10.90 credit was issued to the customer's ZUS Balance as compensation.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving a Hot Buttercrème Latté that was only half full, despite no spillage. The agent explained that the buttercream had dissipated due to heat, which contributed to the issue. The customer requested a voucher instead of a replacement drink, and the agent credited RM10.90 to the customer's account as a resolution. The root cause appears to be a combination of miscommunication about the drink's presentation and a quality control issue in drink preparation.",PRODUCT QUALITY / HYGIENE ISSUE,75,QUALITY COMPLAINT - DRINK,80,Quality Complaint - Drink,4966

agent: The ZUS Coffee Referral Program is a program that rewards existing ZUS App users for referring their friends to the app.

When a friend signs up using a referral code and makes their first in-app purchase, both the referrer and the friend receive reward vouchers.

You can earn discount vouchers based on your member level and the number of successful referrals you have.

The higher your member level and the more successful referrals you make, the better discount vouchers you can receive.

When your friends sign up with your referral code, they will have to make their first in-app purchase to be entitled to the ZUS app referee journey.

Here are the vouchers that your friend can unlock progressively:
1. 60% OFF Top Picks
2. Buy 1 and get 50% OFF
3. Ultimate voucher pack

",Order Info / Status,Missed Out - Order,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect order received and missing items  
Identified Problem: Order fulfillment error leading to missing items (Matcha Strawberry Latté and sugar sachet)  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication during order preparation  
- Lack of available delivery personnel for replacement orders  
Resolution Offered: Replacement order sent free of charge; refund initiated for the cancelled order  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced an issue with their order where they received the wrong item (only a caffe latte instead of the Matcha Strawberry Latté) and did not receive the requested sugar sachets. The customer expressed frustration, particularly as this affected their sister emotionally. The agent offered to send a replacement order at no cost due to the customer's financial concerns. However, the replacement order was later cancelled due to a lack of available delivery personnel, leading to a refund process that the customer did not see reflected in their account.

Resolution Offered: A refund of RM11.90 was issued to the customer's ZUS Balance, and feedback was promised to be relayed to the appropriate team for improvement.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of two drinks received, stating that both tasted like Spanish lattes instead of the expected Iced Jasmine Cham Latte. The agent confirmed that the drinks were prepared according to procedure but acknowledged the customer's feedback and issued a refund. The root cause appears to be a potential inconsistency in drink preparation and a lack of jasmine fragrance in the product.",PRODUCT QUALITY / HYGIENE ISSUE,85,QUALITY COMPLAINT - DRINK,85,Quality Complaint - Drink,4912

The agent provided information about the packaging fee and assured the customer that their requests would be communicated to the barista.

",Cancellation,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Duplicate order cancellation  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication and lack of clarity in the chat interface  
Contributing Factors:  
- The agent repeatedly failed to understand the customer's request for cancellation due to a duplicate order.  
- The chat interface prompted the customer to select options instead of allowing for clear communication, leading to confusion.  
Resolution Offered: The order was eventually refunded and canceled to the customer's ZUS Balance.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially contacted support to cancel a duplicate order (ID: 24071608115). Throughout the interaction, the agent struggled to comprehend the customer's request, leading to frustration. The main issue stemmed from miscommunication and the limitations of the chat interface, which prompted the customer to select options rather than allowing for a straightforward conversation. Ultimately, the order was canceled and refunded, but the interaction highlighted significant communication barriers that contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,80,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,5118

436368,"Hi There,

I would like to lodge an official complaint towards ZUS Coffee branch The
Flo Damansara. I had made an order at 14.57pm, 3rd July 2024. Order ID
24070324772. Basically I did not receive the order and drinks and claim as
the order is sent. RM38.90, in total 4 drinks is not a big amount but yet
doing business, for me as a consumer, is cheating. The driver called me
coincidently I was in a meeting which had passed the call. I got my staff
to call back right away, however the answer he got from the driver was
""call no pick up"" and ""don't know where it's located"", so the order was
sent back to the store.

I am clearly written about the special remark on my shop name and which
floor. My other concern is, if it is sent back to the store, why did I not
receive any call or notification from the store to notify me and arrange
for pick up? Is this how Zus Coffee trains all the staff and causes this
type of trouble?

Basically I am from the service line as well. I feel it is not right if
this is how Zus coffee handles this type of case or order. yet I have
given a few attempts for a call but it is ""user busy"" at all the time.  It
is totally without responsibility for customer care.

I hope I can get an explanation from you all regarding this case by 1pm
tomorrow and kindly make a refund for this order.  Else I will officially
lodge a complaint to KPDN and contact my current officer to visit the store
in Zus Coffee @ The Flo Damansara.

Attach with the proof of order for reference.

Thank you.

Karmen Khoo

Primary Concern: Missing chocolate drizzle in the order and incorrect item received  
Identified Problem: The customer received an incorrect drink without the requested chocolate drizzle and was not informed about the absence of whipped cream for delivery orders.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clarity in the order preparation process leading to missing items.  
- Miscommunication regarding the availability of whipped cream for delivery orders, which was not clearly conveyed to the customer prior to the order.  
Resolution Offered: The agent offered to resend the correct drink with the chocolate drizzle to the same address and confirmed that the customer could keep the incorrect drink without needing to return it.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially raised a concern about receiving the wrong item in their order, specifically missing the chocolate drizzle and not receiving whipped cream. The agent acknowledged the issue and clarified that whipped cream is not served for delivery due to hygiene reasons. The agent then arranged for a new order to be sent with the correct item, addressing the customer's concerns.

Primary Concern: Order not received  
Identified Problem: Order was routed to the wrong location due to a sudden address change  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer did not receive their order because it was sent to an incorrect address (Wisma) instead of their intended location (NU).  
- The system's inability to amend the order after it was prepared and the lack of options for the customer to retrieve the order.  

Resolution Offered: A 50% discount voucher for the next purchase was provided to the customer.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving their order, which was mistakenly routed to a different location due to a sudden address change. The agent explained that once the order was prepared, it could not be amended, and they could not arrange for a rider to pick up the order. As a resolution, the agent offered a 50% discount voucher for the customer's next purchase. The root cause of the issue was the misrouting of the order due to the address change and the limitations of the system in handling such situations.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,85,WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS - VOUCHER CODE,85,Wrong Outlet / Address - Voucher Code,5138

Firstly, the order not go in the system and i just wait in car, i felt took
too long time and why no any update and walk in the shop and check with the

Secondly, there was no sticker on the cup. I ordered CEO COCONUT LATTE with
double BOSS SHOT(use the voucher). But when I took the first sip, I was
very surprised. Because it was too sweet. This was not the CEO I usually
drink. The barista put condensed milk, so it was not what I ordered. I was
very frustrated and spoil my whole morning……
