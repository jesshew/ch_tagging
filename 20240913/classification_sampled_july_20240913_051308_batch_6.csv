This ticket is closed and merged into ticket 450393",Payment,Payment Error / Failure,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Double payment charges for a gift card transaction  
Identified Problem: The customer was charged RM30 for a gift card but only intended to send RM15, leading to confusion and frustration over the refund process.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The payment for the additional RM15 was still in a pending status and not captured by the payment gateway.  
- The customer was not informed clearly about the refund process and the time it would take for the bank to reverse the funds.  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that they would need to wait for the transaction to decline for the funds to be reversed, and that the refund processing time depends on the bank.  
Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer who was frustrated about being double charged for a gift card transaction. The agent explained that the additional charge was pending and could not be canceled, requiring the customer to wait for the bank to decline the transaction for a refund. The root cause of the issue appears to be a miscommunication regarding the payment status and the refund process, leading to the customer's dissatisfaction.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,85,Double Payment Charges,5561

Identified Problem: Miscommunication or system error regarding the status of the top-up transactions.  
Contributing Factors:

Primary Concern: Customer did not receive their order despite it being marked as delivered.  
Identified Problem: The delivery rider returned the order to the outlet instead of delivering it to the customer.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the delivery status.  
- Possible operational issues with the delivery process (e.g., rider not delivering the order).  
Resolution Offered: The agent arranged for a new order to be sent to the customer and provided a new order ID.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially reached out to inquire about their order, which was marked as delivered, but they had not received it. After some back and forth, the agent discovered that the rider had returned the order to the outlet. The agent then offered to send a new order to the customer, which was accepted. The root cause of the issue appears to be a failure in the delivery process, leading to the order not reaching the customer.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,FAILED DELIVERY,85,Failed Delivery,5327

Primary Concern: Presence of a foreign object and an unusual smell in drinks  
Identified Problem: Potential contamination or quality issue with the packaging used for delivery  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer reported a foreign object in their order, indicating a hygiene concern.  
- The customer expressed discomfort regarding an odd smell from the packaging, which raised concerns about the safety of the drinks.  
Resolution Offered: The agent reassured the customer that the paper used for delivery does not contain harmful substances but did not provide a direct resolution to the smell issue.  
Overall Summary: The customer raised a hygiene concern regarding a foreign object found in their order and reported an unusual smell from the packaging of their drinks, which made them apprehensive about consuming the products. The agent acknowledged the complaint and provided some reassurance about the safety of the packaging but did not address the specific smell issue adequately.

Primary Concern: Inability to change order from pickup to delivery  
Identified Problem: The system does not allow for changes or cancellations once an order is placed.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clarity in communication regarding order modification policies  
- Customer's inability to pick up the drink, leading to the need for a delivery option  
Resolution Offered: Customer was advised to arrange for a rider to collect the order, as cancellation or amendment was not possible.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Ayako Chihara, expressed frustration over being unable to change her order from pickup to delivery after it had already been placed. The main issue stemmed from the system's policy that does not allow for modifications once an order is confirmed. Contributing factors included unclear communication about these policies and the customer's situation of being unable to pick up the drink. The agent suggested that the customer could arrange for a third-party rider to collect the order, but this did not address the customer's primary concern effectively.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,80,PICKUP / DELIVERY MISTAKES,85,Pickup / Delivery Mistakes,4856

- Inability to change or cancel the order once it is being prepared by the outlet  
Resolution Offered: 50% discount voucher for future use  
Overall Summary: The customer, Bryan Heng, faced an issue with an incorrect order location, having mistakenly ordered from Batu Pahat Mall instead of Batu Pahat Brunch. The agent informed him that once the order was being prepared, it could not be canceled or changed. As a resolution, the agent offered a 50% discount voucher for future orders. The root cause of the issue appears to be a lack of a confirmation step in the ordering process, which could help prevent such mistakes.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,85,WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS - VOUCHER CODE,85,Wrong Outlet / Address - Voucher Code,4976

Contributing Factors:  
- The refund request was submitted but is still being processed by the finance team  
- The customer was not informed of the estimated time for the refund initially, leading to confusion  
Resolution Offered: The agent confirmed that the refund request was submitted and provided an estimated timeline of 14 working days for processing  
Overall Summary: The customer, Nurul Faizah, expressed frustration over not receiving a refund for a double payment made on June 18, 2024, despite waiting for a week. The agent acknowledged the delay, informed the customer that the refund request was submitted, and provided an estimated processing time of 14 working days. The root cause of the issue appears to be internal processing delays within the finance team, compounded by a lack of timely communication regarding the refund timeline.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,90,REFUND STATUS,85,Refund Status,4788

",Outlet,Performance - Barista Behaviour / Service,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: The customer received a drink that was bitter and did not receive requested sugar sachets.  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication and failure to fulfill customer requests during the order process.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer noted specific requests in the app that were overlooked by the staff.  
- The barista did not acknowledge the customer's requests or provide a courteous service experience.  
Resolution Offered: A 20% discount voucher valid for 14 days was provided as compensation.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed dissatisfaction with their first experience at ZUS Coffee due to receiving a bitter drink and not receiving requested sugar sachets. The issue stemmed from a failure in communication and service by the staff, who did not adhere to the customer's notes in the app. Although a 20% discount voucher was offered as compensation, the customer was frustrated by the short expiry date of the voucher, as they do not have a ZUS Coffee location nearby. The interaction ended with the customer feeling that their concerns were not fully addressed.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,MISSED OUT - DRINKS REMARKS,85,Missed Out - Drinks Remarks,6980

Primary Concern: Duplicate payment for a top-up that appeared as pending in the app.  
Identified Problem: The app did not process the top-up correctly, leading to a double charge.  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error in the app causing the top-up to show as pending despite the bank deduction.  
- Lack of a unique order ID for the top-up transaction, complicating the tracking of the issue.  
Resolution Offered: Refund for the duplicate payment will be processed within 14 working days.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced an issue with the ZUS app where a top-up transaction appeared as pending, resulting in a double charge to their bank account. The agent identified that the app mistakenly charged the customer twice and initiated a refund process. The root cause of the issue was a system error in the app that failed to properly process the transaction, compounded by the absence of an order ID for tracking.

Primary Concern: Delay in receiving a refund for a payment error  
Identified Problem: The customer experienced a payment error and was not refunded in a timely manner due to a closed outlet and possible system issues.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The outlet was closed, leading to the payment failure.  
- The customer faced communication barriers with the agent, resulting in repeated inquiries without clear answers.  
Resolution Offered: Refund processed to the customer's ZUS Balance, with instructions to check the balance in the app.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Nor Azli, expressed frustration over a delayed refund of RM 11.90 due to a payment error linked to a closed outlet. Despite multiple inquiries, the customer felt their concerns were not adequately addressed, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction. The agent eventually confirmed that the refund was processed to the ZUS Balance, but the customer was still uncertain about its visibility in the app. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of the outlet's closure and communication difficulties during the chat.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND ERROR / FAILURE,85,Refund Error / Failure,5715

",Outlet,Wrong Order / Item(s),Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Inability to amend an order after it has been placed  
Identified Problem: Policy that prohibits changes to orders once they are confirmed and a rider is assigned  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication regarding order amendment policies prior to placing the order  
- Possible system limitations that prevent order modifications after confirmation  
Resolution Offered: None; the agent informed the customer that amendments are not possible after order placement  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over the inability to modify their order after it was placed. The main issue stems from the company's policy that does not allow changes once a rider is assigned, which may not have been clearly communicated to the customer beforehand.

",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Drink,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Incorrect beverage quantity received  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication regarding the ""less ice"" request leading to a lesser quantity of the drink  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer's misunderstanding of the ""less ice"" option affecting drink quantity  
- Lack of clarity in communication about how the ""less ice"" option impacts the overall beverage volume  
Resolution Offered: Refund of RM10.90 via ZUS Balance, with the option to contact the outlet manager for further assistance  
Overall Summary: The customer initially reported a spillage issue but later clarified that the problem was related to receiving a lesser quantity of their Iced Spanish Latt√©, which they attributed to a barista mistake. The agent explained that the ""less ice"" option would not reduce the drink's ingredients but acknowledged the customer's concern. A refund was offered as a resolution, and the customer was advised to contact the outlet manager for further confirmation. The root cause of the issue appears to be a misunderstanding of the implications of the ""less ice"" request and insufficient communication regarding the drink preparation process.",ORDER ACCURACY,85,FOAM ISSUE,75,Foam Issue,5979

Primary Concern: Delay in order preparation and inability to cancel the order

Contributing Factors:  
- High volume of orders leading to delays  
- Lack of real-time updates on order status for the customer

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a significant delay in their order preparation, stating that it would take an hour and that no orders had been completed in the last 30 minutes. The agent initially informed the customer that the order could not be canceled as it was being prepared, which was later contradicted by the customer's observation. The agent offered a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance, which was accepted.

I placed 2 ordered separately. Topped up RM3 for Oat base. However, your staff ZyFaa said Oatside out of stock in replacement for Oatly.  I requested to made one for Oatly base, the other to Almond base. That's simple.
Totally disappointed with your staff insisting both had to be same choice of base!
I beg your pardon, could you explain on her behalf what's wrong with the staff understanding of customer's request.

Very dissatisfied with the service & ordered. Making payment of what a customer's choice yet we couldn't get what we wanted. We wish to have an explanation if it means to compensation for a drink of Almond base.

Hope to hear from you soon.
