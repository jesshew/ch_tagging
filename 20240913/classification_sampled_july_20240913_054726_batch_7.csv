",Feedback / Improvement,App - OTP,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Neutral  
Primary Concern: The customer experienced an issue with a top-up transaction not reflecting in the app despite being deducted from their bank account.  
Identified Problem: A system error in the app that caused the transaction to show as rejected.  
Contributing Factors:  
- System error in the ZUS Coffee app leading to transaction failures.  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the nature of the transaction (top-up vs. order).  
Resolution Offered: The agent acknowledged the issue, confirmed that the top-up amount was eventually reflected in the customer's account, and apologized for the inconvenience caused.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced a problem where a RM10 top-up was deducted from their bank account but did not reflect in the ZUS Coffee app, showing as rejected instead. The agent struggled to understand the issue due to miscommunication and repeated requests for an order ID, which was not applicable. Eventually, the agent confirmed that a system issue was responsible for the error, and the customer’s top-up amount was successfully reflected in their account. The interaction highlighted a system error as the root cause of the issue.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,80,ZUS BALANCE WITHDRAWAL,70,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,6086

Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery  
Identified Problem: Delivery rider did not follow the designated route, leading to a significant delay in receiving the order.

",Order Info / Status,Missed Out - Order,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Missing items from the order (specifically, Chocolate Rolls)  
Identified Problem: The customer did not receive the Chocolate Rolls as part of their order.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Possible miscommunication or error during the order fulfillment process.

Primary Concern: The customer received a coffee that was not prepared according to their specifications, resulting in a bitter taste.  
Identified Problem: Miscommunication or error in the preparation of the coffee order by the barista.

",Outlet,Quality Complaint - Drink,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Quality of the drink received  
Identified Problem: The drink did not meet the customer's expectations in terms of taste and quality, specifically the coffee flavor.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication regarding the need for a picture of the drink's label for further investigation.  
- Customer dissatisfaction with the preparation of the drink, claiming it did not match the advertised quality.  
Resolution Offered: The agent suggested that the customer could add an extra shot of espresso to enhance the drink's flavor and reiterated that the outlet followed standard operating procedures.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over the quality of their drink, stating they could barely taste the coffee. The agent requested a picture of the drink's label for further investigation, which the customer could not provide. The agent confirmed that the drink was prepared according to standard procedures but offered no satisfactory resolution to the customer's concerns about the drink's taste. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of miscommunication regarding the evidence needed for the complaint and the perceived inadequacy of the drink's preparation.",PRODUCT QUALITY / HYGIENE ISSUE,85,QUALITY COMPLAINT - DRINK,85,Quality Complaint - Drink,7788

- Possible system error leading to double payment  
- Bank processing issues affecting transaction outcomes  
Resolution Offered: Refund for the duplicate payment, with a processing time of 7 to 14 working days  
Overall Summary: The customer, Nurul Amira, raised a concern regarding being charged twice for an order. The agent acknowledged the issue, attributing it to a rare occurrence possibly linked to bank processing errors. The agent assured the customer that a refund would be processed, requiring additional bank details, and provided proof of the refund submission. The resolution involved a wait time of 7 to 14 working days for the refund to be credited. The root cause appears to be a combination of system errors and bank-related issues leading to the double payment.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,90,DOUBLE PAYMENT CHARGES,90,Double Payment Charges,5384

",Feedback / Improvement,KDS & Xilnex Issue,Tech,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to an incorrect order or outlet.  
Identified Problem: The customer was unable to successfully communicate their request to cancel the order, leading to confusion and frustration.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication between the customer and the agent regarding the cancellation process.  
- The system's automatic handling of order status and refunds may not have been clearly explained to the customer.  
Resolution Offered: The agent mentioned that if a rider could not be found after three attempts, the system would automatically refund the order. However, the customer was still seeking to cancel the order directly.  
Overall Summary: The interaction involved a customer, Luz Tang, who was trying to cancel an order due to it being incorrect. The agent struggled to understand the cancellation request, leading to repeated attempts by the customer to clarify their needs. The customer expressed frustration over the lack of clear communication and resolution. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of miscommunication and the automated system's handling of order statuses, which did not align with the customer's immediate request for cancellation.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,75,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,4874

- Possible bank processing errors leading to perceived double charges  
- Lack of immediate verification of the customer's claim, requiring additional documentation

Eventually, after connecting with a live agent, the order was cancelled, and a refund was processed. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of system errors and ineffective automated responses.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,85,CANCELLATION - INCORRECT ORDER,85,Cancellation - Incorrect Order,5733

- Miscommunication regarding the source of the voucher (Samsung vs. coffee chain)  
- Lack of clarity in the app's handling of third-party vouchers  
Resolution Offered: The agent recommended contacting Samsung Customer Service for assistance with the voucher.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over an issue with claiming a voucher, which was ultimately identified as being issued by Samsung rather than the coffee chain's app. The agent clarified that there was no record of the voucher in their system and advised the customer to reach out to Samsung for further assistance. The interaction highlighted a miscommunication regarding the source of the voucher and the app's limitations in handling third-party vouchers.",GENERAL INQUIRY / PRODUCT INQUIRY,70,INQUIRY / METHOD,75,Inquiry / Method,4748

",Outlet,OOS,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer ordered a drink via the app, but it was out of stock upon arrival at the store.  
Identified Problem: Lack of inventory management leading to stock discrepancies.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The app indicated the order was ready for pickup despite the item being out of stock.  
- Possible miscommunication between the app's inventory system and the physical store's stock availability.  
Resolution Offered: A refund of RM33.80 was credited to the customer's ZUS Balance.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over ordering a drink through the ZUS app, which indicated it was ready for pickup, only to find out it was out of stock at the store.

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving a Dairy milk latte instead of the requested OATLY plant-based milk, for which they had paid an additional RM3.90. The agent acknowledged the mistake, offered to resend the correct item, but the customer declined due to it being after office hours.

agent: For your inquiry regarding ZUS Coffee, please select the country you are interested in

user: Hi,

I want to make a complaint.

1. on 10/7/2024 I made a purchase at Zus Coffee Pertama Kompleks.

2. I made only 2 orders which are Iced Spanish Latte and Iced Australian Chocolate.

3. But the cashier key in 3 orders which are 1 Iced Spanish Latte and 2x Iced Spanish Chocolate.

4. The cashier has no coins left to return to the customer.

5. The distance from my office to Zus Coffee is not far, only from epf to the first complex.

6. As a result of the cup lid not being tight, water has spilled inside the motor box and I'm not angry but want to make sure next time make sure the lid is tight before giving it to the customer

7. It's just that I feel wrong because the water has just spilled in the motor basket.

Yours sincerely

",Delivery,Rider Behavior,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Request for a refund for order ID 24080247377  
Identified Problem: Delay in processing the refund due to a lack of confirmation from the customer’s end  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer's response not being reflected in the system  
- Miscommunication regarding the refund process and timeline  
Resolution Offered: Refund processed to the customer's ZUS Balance  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving a refund for their order after two days. The agent initially indicated that the refund had not been initiated due to a lack of confirmation from the customer. After further communication, the agent confirmed that the refund was processed to the customer's ZUS Balance. The root cause of the issue appears to be a miscommunication and a potential system error that led to the customer's response not being recorded properly.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,85,REFUND ERROR / FAILURE,85,Refund Error / Failure,5231

You replaced the order number but not the drinks. The supposedly hot latte
was only slighly warm when I got it. Had to take the trouble to heat it .
Some of the ice cubes had melted.

Btw the first rider made unreasonable excuses when I called him, blaming
the outlet.

Primary Concern: Delay in receiving the correct order and poor quality of the drinks  
Identified Problem: The initial rider did not collect the order, leading to a replacement order being necessary

- Miscommunication between the rider and the outlet regarding order collection

Overall Summary: The customer, Sahidah Salleh, expressed frustration over a delay in receiving her coffee order, which was compounded by the poor quality of the drinks delivered.

The agent assured the customer that the rider's behavior would be reported and emphasized the company's commitment to improving delivery service.

",Outlet,Performance - Barista Behaviour / Service,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Consistently receiving poorly made coffee from the barista at ZUS Temerloh.  
Identified Problem: Lack of proper training or adherence to standard operating procedures (SOP) by the barista, leading to poor quality drinks.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Repeated complaints from multiple customers about the same issue.  
- Customer's reluctance to formally report the issue due to being busy, which may prevent management from addressing the problem effectively.  
Resolution Offered: The agent requested a photo of the drink to escalate the issue to management, but no immediate resolution was provided during the chat.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over consistently receiving bitter coffee from the barista at ZUS Temerloh, indicating a lack of skill or adherence to SOPs. Despite previous complaints, the issue persists, leading to dissatisfaction with the service. The agent attempted to escalate the matter but did not provide a resolution during the interaction. The root cause appears to be inadequate training or oversight of barista performance.",OUTLET OPERATIONS,85,PERFORMANCE - BARISTA BEHAVIOUR / SERVICE,90,Performance - Barista Behaviour / Service,5433

",Delivery,Spillage,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Appreciative  
Primary Concern: Spillage of drinks during delivery  
Identified Problem: Delivery mishandling leading to spillage  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of proper packaging or handling during delivery  
- Possible miscommunication regarding the delivery process  
Resolution Offered: Refund issued to the customer's ZUS balance for the affected drinks  
Overall Summary: The customer reported an issue with spillage of four bottles during delivery. The agent acknowledged the problem, requested confirmation of the number of spilled bottles, and asked for pictures, which the customer was unable to provide due to already cleaning the bottles. The agent assured the customer that the issue would be escalated to the outlet manager and a refund would be credited to the customer's ZUS balance. The interaction ended positively, with the customer expressing gratitude for the assistance provided.

- Urgency from the payment partner (Fiuu) to resolve the dispute to avoid financial loss for the merchant.  
Resolution Offered: The merchant was advised to verify the transaction and respond to the dispute inquiry promptly to avoid bearing the loss.  
Overall Summary: The interaction revolves around a dispute for transaction ID 2282642710, where the customer paid through Boost, but the Zus system did not receive the payment.

The agent requested necessary details for processing a refund and assured the customer that the issue would be addressed to prevent recurrence.

",Outlet,Foam Issue,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: The customer received drinks with lesser quantities than expected.  
Identified Problem: The drinks were not filled to the expected level, leading to dissatisfaction.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Lack of clear communication regarding the expected quantity of drinks.  
- Possible inconsistency in drink preparation at the outlet.  
Resolution Offered: The agent requested additional images of the drinks for further investigation and offered to make things right.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over receiving drinks that were significantly underfilled, with one drink having a noticeable gap of over 1.5 inches from the top. The agent acknowledged the issue and requested further evidence to address the complaint. However, the conversation ended without a definitive resolution, as the agent assumed the customer had stepped away after not receiving a response for some time.

The rider claimed he was unaware of the delivery instructions, which were supposed to be in the app. The agent acknowledged the issue and promised to report the rider's behavior, but the customer remained dissatisfied with the service. The root cause appears to be a breakdown in communication regarding delivery instructions.",PROBLEMATIC / FAILED DELIVERY,85,RIDER BEHAVIOR,85,Rider Behavior,5304

Primary Concern: Invalid phone number registration and missing coffee club points  
Identified Problem: The customer's phone number is not recognized in the system, leading to issues with account registration and coffee club point accumulation.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer provided a phone number that the system does not recognize as registered.  
- The order in question was cancelled, which resulted in no points being awarded for the purchase.
