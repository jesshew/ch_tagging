Kindly be informed that you may need to purchase using ZUS apps in order for your ZUS points to be active in your ZUS account. You may refer to our FAQ as per above.

agent: Hope this clarifies. Apart from this, Is there anything else we could assist you with?
user: But i was active here, no?
user: Everytime i purchase, your teams at the cafes only asked for phone number. Never the app
user: Hello?
agent: Certainly, when you enter the outlet, they will request your phone number to accrue points on your ZUS app. It is also crucial to place your order through the ZUS app to ensure its continued activity and prevent your ZUS points from expiring.
agent: I hope this clears things up. Additionally, is there anything else we can help you with?

Primary Concern: Points balance discrepancy in the ZUS app  
Identified Problem: Lack of clarity in the app regarding point accumulation and inactivity policies  
Contributing Factors:  
- Customer was not informed that purchases must be made through the ZUS app to maintain points.  
- The app's communication regarding point expiration due to inactivity was unclear.  
Resolution Offered: The agent acknowledged the issue and promised to forward feedback for improvement, but no immediate resolution to the points discrepancy was provided.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a significant drop in their points balance from 194 to 10 after a recent purchase. The agent explained that points require app-based purchases to remain active and that inactivity could lead to point expiration. The customer felt that the app should have communicated these policies more clearly. While the agent apologized and promised to relay the feedback for future improvements, the customer's immediate concern regarding their points was not resolved.",LOYALTY AND REWARDS,85,APP - LOYALTY ISSUE,85,App - Loyalty Issue,5174

",Outlet,OOS,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer faced issues with stock availability and order cancellation, leading to a request for a refund and compensation.  
Identified Problem: The main issue stemmed from a lack of stock for the soft serve item, which was still listed as available in the app, causing confusion and dissatisfaction.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Technical issues with the app displaying out-of-stock items as available.  
- Poor communication regarding stock availability and order status, leading to customer frustration.  
Resolution Offered: Refund processed via ZUS Balance and a 20% discount voucher offered for future purchases.  
Overall Summary: The customer experienced significant frustration due to their last two orders being canceled because the soft serve was out of stock, despite being listed as available in the app. This led to a lengthy refund process and dissatisfaction with the offered compensation. The root cause appears to be a technical issue with the app and inadequate communication regarding stock levels, which negatively impacted the customer experience.",ORDER FULFILLMENT,85,OOS,90,OOS,8270

Overall Summary: The customer experienced an issue where a RM10 top-up was deducted from their bank account but was marked as rejected in the ZUS Coffee app. The agent acknowledged the inconvenience and explained that the payment had failed, advising the customer to try a different payment method. The root cause appears to be a failure in the payment processing system, compounded by insufficient communication regarding the pre-authorization hold by the bank.",PAYMENT AND REFUNDS,90,PAYMENT ERROR / FAILURE,90,Payment Error / Failure,5378

",Order Info / Status,Pickup / Delivery Mistakes,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to cancel an order due to selecting the wrong pickup option.  
Identified Problem: The order was already in the preparation stage, preventing cancellation.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The customer selected the wrong pickup option (pickup instead of delivery).  
- Lack of clarity on the cancellation policy once the order is being prepared.  
Resolution Offered: The agent suggested using a delivery service (Grab Express/Lalamove) to pick up the order instead of canceling it.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over being unable to cancel their order (ID: 24080143542) after mistakenly selecting pickup instead of delivery. The order was already being prepared, which led to the inability to cancel. The agent offered a workaround by suggesting the use of a delivery service to retrieve the order. The root cause of the issue appears to be a combination of the customer's error in selecting the pickup option and the store's policy regarding order cancellations once preparation has begun.",ORDER PLACEMENT ERRORS,85,PICKUP / DELIVERY MISTAKES,85,Pickup / Delivery Mistakes,4680

- Distance to the incorrect outlet (50km away) causing inconvenience  
Resolution Offered: 50% discount voucher for the next purchase  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over placing an order at the wrong outlet and was unable to change or cancel it after it was prepared. The agent explained that once the order is received and prepared, changes cannot be made, which contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction. A 50% discount voucher was offered as compensation, but the customer indicated that this experience discouraged them from using the app in the future. The root cause of the issue appears to be a lack of clarity in the ordering process, particularly regarding outlet selection.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,85,WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS - VOUCHER CODE,85,Wrong Outlet / Address - Voucher Code,4933

",Customer Account Details,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,Marketing,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Customer wants to withdraw money from their ZUS wallet.  
Identified Problem: The ZUS wallet balance is linked to a gift card, which is non-exchangeable for cash.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding the functionality of the ZUS wallet and gift card policies.  
- Repeated responses from the agent that did not address the customer's specific request.  
Resolution Offered: The agent clarified that the ZUS balance is a result of a gift card reload and cannot be exchanged for cash.  
Overall Summary: The customer, Syafikah Sadik, expressed frustration over their inability to withdraw money from their ZUS wallet. The main issue stemmed from the fact that the wallet balance was linked to a gift card, which is non-exchangeable for cash. The interaction was marked by miscommunication, as the agent repeatedly provided information about redeeming gift cards instead of addressing the withdrawal request directly. Ultimately, the customer was informed of the policy regarding the gift card, but their primary concern remained unresolved.",ACCOUNT & CONTACT MANAGEMENT,75,ZUS BALANCE WITHDRAWAL,85,ZUS Balance Withdrawal,5086

Primary Concern: Incorrect order location leading to inability to cancel the order  
Identified Problem: The customer selected the wrong outlet for their order, which was already prepared, preventing cancellation.  
Contributing Factors:  
- Miscommunication regarding outlet names and their order processing system  
- Lack of clarity in the app regarding outlet selection, leading to confusion  
Resolution Offered: A one-time exception was made to cancel the order and issue a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance, along with a 50% voucher for future purchases.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially faced an issue with ordering from the wrong outlet, which led to frustration when they were unable to cancel the order after it was prepared. The agent explained that cancellations are not possible once an order is prepared, but after further discussion, a one-time exception was made to process a refund to the customer's ZUS Balance. The customer expressed dissatisfaction with the outlet naming convention in the app, suggesting that state names should precede outlet names to avoid future confusion. Ultimately, the issue stemmed from a combination of miscommunication and system limitations regarding order management.",LOCATION AND ADDRESS ISSUES,85,WRONG OUTLET / ADDRESS - VOUCHER CODE,85,Wrong Outlet / Address - Voucher Code,7506

",Outlet,OOS,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Missing promotional sticker from order  
Identified Problem: Barista overlooked the inclusion of the free sticker due to a system error and stock unavailability.  
Contributing Factors:

Resolution Offered: Refund for the affected orders and a 20% voucher as a token of apology, which the customer declined in favor of a refund.

",Delivery,Spillage,Operation,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Spillage of drinks onto food items during delivery  
Identified Problem: Poor packaging design leading to spillage  
Contributing Factors:  
- Food items packed underneath cold drinks, causing potential for spillage  
- Inadequate communication and follow-up from customer service agents  
Resolution Offered: Request for images of the affected items for further assessment  
Overall Summary: The customer, Poey Wong, experienced a spillage issue where drinks leaked onto food items due to poor packaging design. The customer expressed frustration over the handling of their complaint, feeling that their issue was not adequately addressed and that the chat was closed prematurely without resolution. The root cause of the issue appears to be the packaging method used for the delivery, which did not prevent spillage, compounded by ineffective communication from the customer service team.",ORDER HANDLING AND PACKAGING,85,PACKAGING,90,Packaging,7954

Good day ! I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the poor quality
straw i have experience.

*Please refer to the attach photo .*

The straw cracked after 1-2 hours and could no longer be used at all . I
don't think it's possible for everyone to finish their drinks within an
hour. I understand that ZUS chooses to use rice paper straws instead of
plastic straws because it does not cause serious harm to the environment
and other organisms but I also hope that some improvements can be made.

As a customer , we would appreciate it if your team could make the
improvement as outlined. Thanks !

Primary Concern: Missing Free Matcha Macam Sticker from order  
Identified Problem: The customer did not receive the promotional sticker that was supposed to be included with their order.

After confirming the issue, the agent offered a 20% discount voucher as compensation, explaining that the sticker could only be picked up at the original outlet.

Please be informed that I did not receive my coffee this morning due to Zus
apps problem. In the apps it shows that it has been delivered but I did not
receive it.

Received a call from the driver 011 3711 5289 mentioning that the app has
an issue and they are not able to cancel it from their end or the outlet
(as he is at the outlet to pick up the order)

He then called again when I was in  a meeting asking me to cancel the order
via Zus apps and when i'm not able to do so I was scolded and cursed.

Please look into this. I want my refund and apology from your end. It has
ruined my day just because I was F* by a rider due to your apps issues.

Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery and inability to change the store

Contributing Factors:  
- High volume of inquiries leading to delayed responses  
- System limitations preventing order modifications or driver allocation  

Resolution Offered: Auto-refund to ZUS Balance and suggestion to reorder from another outlet or choose self-pickup

The agent informed the customer that the order was still in the process of allocating a driver and that if the driver could not be allocated after three attempts, the order would be auto-refunded. The customer also requested to change the store, but the agent was unable to assist due to system limitations. Ultimately, the order was auto-refunded, and the customer was advised to reorder or opt for self-pickup.

",Delivery,Slow Delivery Service,Grab,"Customer sentiment: Frustrated  
Primary Concern: Delay in order delivery  
Identified Problem: Order was placed at 10:15 AM but was still not delivered after a significant wait time.  
Contributing Factors:

- External circumstances such as rain affecting the delivery rider's ability to reach the customer on time.  
Resolution Offered: The agent provided tracking information for the delivery and explained the potential delay due to weather conditions.  
Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over a delayed order placed at 10:15 AM, which had not been delivered after a considerable wait. The agent confirmed that the order was still being prepared and later informed the customer that the delivery rider was on the way but might be delayed due to rain.

445109,"Greetings,

I'm writing this email with a heavy heart. On July 20th, 2024, my wife and
I visited the Sunway Carnival Mall in Butterworth and headed to Zus Coffee
to order our usual beverages. However, the experience we had was far from
satisfactory.

As we approached the counter to place our order, the staff member at the
cashier (whose name I'm afraid I didn't catch) informed us that they were
unable to take our order due to a high volume of orders. This same message
was conveyed to the customer who was in line behind us as well.

Despite my polite request to wait and collect the coffee once it was ready,
the staff member insisted that it would take an hour to fulfill our order.
This was especially concerning as the area around the counter appeared to
have no visible crowd or long lines.

I'm truly disappointed by the way this situation was handled by the staff
member. It's a great concern to me that an unqualified individual was
manning the front line, which can significantly impact the Zus brand's
reputation. I strongly believe that your front-line staff require proper
training on customer service and order management to ensure a seamless and
positive experience for all your patrons.

I would greatly appreciate a response from you regarding this matter. If I
do not receive a satisfactory explanation or resolution, I may feel
compelled to share my experience on social media platforms.

I eagerly await your eagerly.

The incident took place between  6.30 to 7.15 pm as I can't really recall
the exact time.

As I was talking to few of my close friends on the incidents are also in
same opinion as me as the customer service needs a major revamp.....

Hope your team will look into it.

Primary Concern: Missing straws from a pickup order  
Identified Problem: The straws were not included in the customer's order at the time of pickup.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was designated as a pickup, which limited the ability to deliver the missing items.  
- Lack of proper packing procedures at the outlet, leading to the omission of straws in the order.

Overall Summary: The customer expressed frustration over not receiving straws with their coffee order, which was a pickup. The agent explained that since it was a pickup order, they could not deliver the missing straws and suggested arranging a pickup. The customer was dissatisfied with this response, feeling that the straws should have been included in the order. As a resolution, the agent offered a complimentary drink voucher as an apology.

",Order Info / Status,Pickup / Delivery Mistakes,Customer,"Customer sentiment: Neutral  
Primary Concern: Customer wanted to change their order from delivery to pick-up.  
Identified Problem: The order had already been picked up by a rider before the customer could change it to pick-up.  
Contributing Factors:  
- The order was still in the preparation stage when the customer initiated the request to change to pick-up.  
- Lack of real-time communication or updates regarding the order status, leading to the customer being unaware that the order was already assigned to a rider.  
Resolution Offered: The agent informed the customer that the order could not be changed to pick-up as it had already been picked up by the rider and provided rider information.  
Overall Summary: The customer initially raised a concern about their order status, specifically wanting to change their delivery order to pick-up. However, the order had already been picked up by a rider, which prevented the requested change. The interaction highlighted a potential issue with order status updates and communication, as the customer was not informed in real-time about the order's progress.

Primary Concern: The customer mistakenly selected pickup instead of delivery for their order.  
Identified Problem: The system does not allow changes from pickup to delivery once the order is submitted.

- The customer was unable to go out from the office to pick up the order.  
- Lack of flexibility in the order management system regarding changing order types after submission.  
Resolution Offered: The agent offered to keep the drink in a chiller until the customer could arrive.
